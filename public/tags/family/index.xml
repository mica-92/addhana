      <description>November 4th was my dad’s birthday so I called home to be present being far away. Truth is while I’m traveling I hardly ever call home, I don’t like it, too much me- focus, but I try to make exceptions during special occasion like this one. Half my family is at the country house, the other is getting there the next day for the big asado.
I haven’t even send him a text message as we were on our technology- free day off, out all day in Tulum; so I decided to do a ‘surprise’ WhatsApp video call.</description>
