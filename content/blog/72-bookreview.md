<cite>Often learn more from one person’s highly idiosyncratic experiences than I do from sources that detail universal principles or cite up-to-date studies. I find greater value in what specific individuals tell me worked for them than in any other kind of argument—and that’s true even when we seem to have nothing in common.</cite>

Gretchen Rubin's "The Happiness Project" is exactly what the title anticipates: a recollection of her journey through finding a greater sense of joy and happiness through small habit changes. So by modifying Benjamin Franklin's scoring chart, Gretchen identified 12 areas (one for each month) that according to studies and her intuition would have the biggest impact on well-being.

I enjoyed reading this book a lot. Happiness, well-being, and habits have been the main focus of my COVID quarantine. I knew great changes were coming ahead and that because of the pandemic there was going to be lots of uncertainty. Like most people, I do not cope well in these types of scenarios. Taking into consideration that my boyfriend and I were going to be trapped 24-7 with each other for the next 4 months, I considered this tectonic.

Like many people, I found the book plain at times. Some of the categories did not resonate with me at all, like parenthood or eternity, and her blog comments annoying. The argument that because her life seems perfect, she is not "allowed" to talk about happiness doesn't resonate with me. Everyone is allowed to find areas of improvement in their life regardless of life's privilege, and you do not have to be poor or disabled to talk about happiness. And in a way, her life resonated more with me than someone that's coming from less favorable circumstances. In the end, the book managed to inspire me and create my version of The Happiness Project (that I'm doing it together with my sister). But, indeed, a little more communal service would not have killed her. 

Overall it is a great bedtime read, but do not expect a writing masterpiece.
