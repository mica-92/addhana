My first week of blogging is over and here are 7 highlights:

1. According to people I write better than I talk (so imagine how I talk)

2. It liberates your mind from random thoughts that keep appearing on a daily basis, itâ€™s all about uncluttering

3. Creating habits is easier when you are doing it with somebody else

4. You can create a great unintended debate at dinnertime

5. The things you are going through can be happening to other people too

6. Everything becomes a writing topic, so I made a list of possible future writing topics

7. I love making lists
