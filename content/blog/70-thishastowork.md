For a sennight, I've been working hard to design the blog I wanted. And deep down I know that day is today that website is going to be deployed into the world-wide-web. 

This is an orison to the HUGO-Gods. All this work is not to be in vain. A command shall appear before I and addhana will go live.

<h2>So please almighty-HUGO, listen to this prayer, and provide the solution to this predicament.</h2>
