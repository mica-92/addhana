# Module 1 & 2 - Material Sciences, QM & Periodic Table

# Lecture 1 - Material Sciences

## What is 'material'?

- Multi-scale structure like bones, are they materials?
- Aluminum the history of the origin of the material is very imprinted all over the material.
- Even simple materials consist of countless structural features at different length scales that have enormous

## Material and Structure

- 10 microns to atoms = realm of the material science.
- 10 nanometers below quantum mechanics realm.
- Micron scales massive systems in term of number of atoms. Associated with structures.
- We care about material science because microscopic characteristics can yield different results in the macroscopic point of view of stuff.
- Regions of order and disorder can be important in polymers.
- **Control of the structural features - why we study material sciences. Blacksmith example.**

## Central Paradigm

- Additional performance box is sort of optional because very interrelated with the properties box.
- **Inverse design problem** = I know the properties I need in a material but not the microstructure. AI and machine learning (new field)

## Process- structure - properties

- EXAMPLE = Cold work steal lots of dislocations. They jam and cannot move easily, high tensile strength. But once it fails it does so rapidly. No change in the composition.

**SUMMARY:** 

# Lecture 2 - Quantum Mechanics

## **Atoms**

- Experiments, how do we know what we know?
    - Electricity = materials tend to be neutral at their bulk? State
- Discovery of the electrons 1897
    - If I have a negative, I need a positive - *Plum Pudding Model*
- Rutherford Experiment
    - Alpha particle bounced back - idea that there was a nucleus, moving with too much momentum to be interacting with the electrons. Only bounced back when it is interacting with the nucleus.
    - Problem = 1. the electrons have to be moving, Coulomb force will pull them and collapse; 2. if a charged particle moves through a electromagnetic field created radiation (Northern Lights, radio waves, cellphones). We generate radiation and energy, the energy is reducing and spiraling again into the nucleus. It is not stable.

    ## Key points

    - The material properties that we measure at macroscopic scales are the result of the combined effects of structural features at many lower length scales

    ## Other inexplicable observations

    - Solar spectrum - discreet pieces of light missing
    - Different gases missing lights that cannot be accounted for. They discovered He
    - **Blackbody Radiation** Max Planck - heating up something until it is glowing, red till blue emitting ultraviolet radiation. Shape of the curve. Discreet frequencies he got the plot. Quantum idea. He did not know why
    - **Photoelectric effect -** reconcile electromagnetism. Maxwell equations couldn't explain the frequency effect.

    ## Rutherford model

    - Coulomb force + Circular motion . These two forces will cancel out.
    - Problems with the velocity

    ## Bohr model

    - What if it is a brooder discretization that is part of the Universe.
    - Fine structure constant
    - Bohr radium is in the order of magnitude of the real size.
    - Are we loosing energy?
    - No basis for quanta but you get the perfect energy ionization of hydrogen.
    - The atom is stable because it cannot loose energy. Ground energy is the lowest limit. This is what we observe in the spectrum - correspond of changes in allowed places. Defined finger prints for elements.
    - No physical basis for this assumption

    ## Wave-particle duality

    - Momentum of a photon is inversely related to lambda.
    - Light has a particle
    - **De Broglie wavelength -** from Einstein he asks the opposite wavelength and momentum wha is that's true for everythin not just for photons.
    - Bohn and Plank assumed de Broglie proved it mathematically.
    - To produce stable orbits.
    - **Doble slit experiment** - point sources. Peaks and deconstructive interactions between waves. One electron at a time so the only way of explaining the formation of the pattern is the electron is interfering with itself. Different spots.
    - Statistical nature of this phenomena.
    - Leave individual marks like particles. Interacts like a particle.

**SUMMARY:**

# Lecture 1 - Quantum Mechanics Formalisms

## Quantum Mechanics

- If the e- is a wave, it has a wave equation. We want to make a wave equation that explains an e- like a wave.
- Phi is a complex function that can evolve in position and time. R = magnitude, S = phase and are both **real**
- Intensity is the R2 is the property we are measuring. The other important consideration is that Phi is **linear** so we can add solutions together and still have a solutions. Therefore, wave functions can interfere with one another, produce interference patterns (e.g., dual slit experiment), etc.—a result of S, the phase

## QM axioms

### Axiom 1

- The wave function is a probability wave of finding the electron at time *t* in a box volume *d3r* at point *r*

![Module%201%20&%202%20-%20Material%20Sciences,%20QM%20&%20Periodic%20Ta%20e72abb2b8ac4473c8c8c2145cfd9535e/Untitled%201.png](/Module%201%20&%202%20-%20Material%20Sciences,%20QM%20&%20Periodic%20Ta%20e72abb2b8ac4473c8c8c2145cfd9535e/Untitled%201.png)

- Assuming that the wave function is properly **normalize**. So, if you add up the probability of the particle appearing at every possible location, the sum should be exactly 1. This means that if I integrate the wave function on all space I'll get a value of 1.

![Module%201%20&%202%20-%20Material%20Sciences,%20QM%20&%20Periodic%20Ta%20e72abb2b8ac4473c8c8c2145cfd9535e/Untitled%202.png](/Module%201%20&%202%20-%20Material%20Sciences,%20QM%20&%20Periodic%20Ta%20e72abb2b8ac4473c8c8c2145cfd9535e/Untitled%202.png)

- So if the value of Phi2 is low the probability of finding the electron at that location is low. And these probability waves interfere with one another, in the same way classical waves do.

![Module%201%20&%202%20-%20Material%20Sciences,%20QM%20&%20Periodic%20Ta%20e72abb2b8ac4473c8c8c2145cfd9535e/Untitled%204.png](/Module%201%20&%202%20-%20Material%20Sciences,%20QM%20&%20Periodic%20Ta%20e72abb2b8ac4473c8c8c2145cfd9535e/Untitled%204.png)

### Axiom 2

- Just as Newton’s laws (F = ma) govern particle motion in classical mechanics, an equation called the **Schrödinger equation governs the evolution of the wave**, and hence the spatial changes to probabilities as a function of time:

![Module%201%20&%202%20-%20Material%20Sciences,%20QM%20&%20Periodic%20Ta%20e72abb2b8ac4473c8c8c2145cfd9535e/Untitled%205.png](/Module%201%20&%202%20-%20Material%20Sciences,%20QM%20&%20Periodic%20Ta%20e72abb2b8ac4473c8c8c2145cfd9535e/Untitled%205.png)

- **Correspondence Principle** - For large systems, or high n, or high mass, the behavior predicted by the Schrödinger equation should map to that predicted by Newton

### Axiom 3

- We have a probability wave function Ѱ, and a fundamental equation describing how Ѱ evolves---but how do these relate to physical, measurable properties? Every property (“observable”) we’d be interested in measuring, such as the particle’s position or speed, has its own “operator” that we apply to the wave function to obtain the desired information. Since the wave function relates to probability, the operator produces an “expectation value” that is a statistical quantity---i.e., the average.

# Lecture 2 - Energy eigenvalues and atoms

Orbitals are not transient, they are stable. De Broglie requires this type of stable state solutions.

Time independent Schrödinger equations - Solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation is an eigenvalue problem.

# Applying the Schrödinger Equation to the Hydrogen Atom

- One atom, one electron, one Coulomb interaction.
- We have to work in 3D, we have a Coulomb potential (V, different to the infinite seen in the well). We need to use Spherical Coordinates.

![Module%201%20&%202%20-%20Material%20Sciences,%20QM%20&%20Periodic%20Ta%20e72abb2b8ac4473c8c8c2145cfd9535e/Untitled%2011.png](/Module%201%20&%202%20-%20Material%20Sciences,%20QM%20&%20Periodic%20Ta%20e72abb2b8ac4473c8c8c2145cfd9535e/Untitled%2011.png)

- The solutions of each of these ODE is what gives rise to the difference quantum numbers and therefore force the quantization.
- Probability distribution. As we increase n we find a couple of nodes. These are multiple preferred distance away from the nucleus, multiple peaks. This is for the radial component.

- We have solutions for the angular component and the radial component and all these are independent from each other. Each of these should be normalized for the product to be normalized.

*Hydrogen like multiple Z but only one electron*

- **Reproduces the Bohr model energy levels.**
- **Spin** associated with angular momentum it has to be + or - 1/2. We add it to the wave function:

![Module%201%20&%202%20-%20Material%20Sciences,%20QM%20&%20Periodic%20Ta%20e72abb2b8ac4473c8c8c2145cfd9535e/Untitled%2015.png](/Module%201%20&%202%20-%20Material%20Sciences,%20QM%20&%20Periodic%20Ta%20e72abb2b8ac4473c8c8c2145cfd9535e/Untitled%2015.png)

**Things we assumed:** Particles have a wave nature (i.e., de Broglie is correct about wave-particle duality). This wave nature obeys a wave equation (the Schrödinger equation). **We did not assume** quantization going into the analysis The quantization emerged necessarily in the process of solving the wave equation PDE, only from the simple assumptions given above

### Degeneracy of the Hydrogen Atom

- Electrons are fermions. When we are dealing with systems that have more than one electron there are restrictions on the quantum number that can be present at a given time.
- **Multiple combinations of *l, m, n* with the same value of energy in the case of Hydrogen**

## Trends in the periodic table

### How do electrons behave in heavier elements?

- So basically what happens is the electrons that are closer to the nucleus are pull tighter than the ones that are far away. As we move away there is an electron screening from the ones that are closer. Therefore it is easier to remove these electrons and these breaks the degeneracy because the interactions with the other electrons affect the quantum numbers.
- Also, for H there is a perfect balancing between the Coulomb and the Centrifugal barrier that cancel out and the Eigenvalues do not depend on the quantum number *l*. But for more electrons because the Coulomb is acting on its entirety because of the screening, these two forces are no longer cancel out.

![Module%201%20&%202%20-%20Material%20Sciences,%20QM%20&%20Periodic%20Ta%20e72abb2b8ac4473c8c8c2145cfd9535e/Untitled%2018.png](/Module%201%20&%202%20-%20Material%20Sciences,%20QM%20&%20Periodic%20Ta%20e72abb2b8ac4473c8c8c2145cfd9535e/Untitled%2018.png)

- Pauli exclusion principle - “Fermions” such as electrons cannot possess the same four quantum numbers in a given system

![Module%201%20&%202%20-%20Material%20Sciences,%20QM%20&%20Periodic%20Ta%20e72abb2b8ac4473c8c8c2145cfd9535e/Untitled%2019.png](/Module%201%20&%202%20-%20Material%20Sciences,%20QM%20&%20Periodic%20Ta%20e72abb2b8ac4473c8c8c2145cfd9535e/Untitled%2019.png)

- **The statement above explains why there can be a maximum of 2 electrons in each orbital**
- **K shell** (n=1) - core electrons. **L- Shell** (n=2), **M-shell, N- shell, etc.**
- With n = 1, *l* can only be 0. With n = 2, *l* can now be -1, 0, 1; etc.
- Lithium and Boron are quite reactive because it has that electron alone in the 2s or 2p orbital.
- Because 2s and 2p are similar in energy and there are some advantages in separating the electrons in each orbital, therefore we form **hybridized orbitals. This is very common in C, it is very versatile**

- Valence electrons is going to influence bonding and how the element interacts with other elements.
