Like everyone else, I heard about this book after reading Marie Kondo's book. We are about to move pretty soon and I need motivation and willingness to let things go. This book provided a lot of motivation for discarding, at times even a little bit too much. 

Nagisa clearly states our underlying motivations for not getting rid of our possessions and how sooner or later stuff just ends up overflowing not only physical space but our mental space as well. But at times the cultural and time differences made the message weak, nothing that an updated international edition cannot fix.

Overall, it is a super-fast read, I took the pertinent notes and I'll probably do what the book suggests, discard it. 

## Highlights
*Things are not simply physical objects. Once we possess them they become part of us. This is the fundamental logic of the consumer society—the feeling that self-realization is achieved through having the things we want.*

*Mottanai* - (japanese, noun) a sense of shame at wastefulness


### Ten attitudes to help you get rid of things
* 1: Don’t keep it “for now”
* 2: Avoid “temporary” storage—decide now!
* 3: “Sometimes” never comes
* 4: “Really convenient!” to somebody else—irritating junk to me
* 5: Nothing is sacred
* 6: If you’ve got it, use it
* 7: Storage and organization methods are not the solutions
* 8: “Maybe this could go…”
* 9: Don’t worry that you’ll get rid of something you shouldn’t
* 10: Don’t Aim for Perfection

### Ten strategies for discarding
* 1: Don’t look—throw!
* 2: Chuck it there and then
* 3: Discard when you exceed a certain amount
* 4: Discard after a certain period of time
* 5: Regular discarding
* 6: Discard things even if they can still be used
* 7: Establish discarding criteria
* 8: Have plenty of disposal routes
* 9: Start small
* 10: Who disposes of what? Decide responsibilities
