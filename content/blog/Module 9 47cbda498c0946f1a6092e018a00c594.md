# Lecture 1: Dislocations

Defects are important because they induce strain in the crystal lattice (with energy penalties)

There is an equilibrium driving force towards some defect concentration and that is a function of temperature. 

## Dislocations (1D)

Just as point defects carry matter when they move, line defects (dislocations) can carry deformation. One can picture the scenario where shear stress is applied to a crystal and eventually all the bonds of the layer break at the same time. This requires a great deal of energy at the same time.

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled.png)

Scenario 2. Breaking only one bond at a time, smaller force that propagates and this is how dislocations work. The end result is the same but the total strength needed in both cases is very different. 

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%201.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%201.png)

In 3D - **edge dislocation** breaks the bond one row at a time. Can move horizontally by breaking neighboring bonds.

**screw dislocations**

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%204.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%204.png)

### Burgers Vector

Displacement vector that tells you the dislocation present in the crystal. Burgers circuit

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%205.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%205.png)

In case one we are shifted to the right one lattice vector. Burger vector **magnitude one perpendicular to the edge dislocation**. In the case of a screw dislocation - **the Burger vector is pointing in the direction of the screw axes**. In both cases the magnitude is 1 but the direction is different. 

There are some dislocations that are mixed. The Burger vector can have some component in between associated with the relative magnitude of the combination of both types.

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%206.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%206.png)

**Dislocations cannot end in an arbitrary place in a crystal they can only end on surfaces, interfaces, itself or other dislocations.** 

Burger vectors are conserved in the case of splitting (i). Edge dislocations can nihilate each other (ii) this has essential implications in material processing (cold working industrial process where dislocations are placed in high densities locations and it increases the strength, there a price it is very brittle and not ductile).

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%207.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%207.png)

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%208.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%208.png)

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%209.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%209.png)

Burger circuit will tell you the sum of all dislocations present in the crystal. For this reason sometimes you want to work with smaller regions. The Burger vector is a translation vector of the crystal and it is usually the shortest. 

**Glide plane. The dislocations would move through the glide plane during deformation, because it is the easiest direction with the lowest energy barrier, one bond at a time to force the dislocation to move,** 

### **Elasticity and how it relates to dislocations**

mu is the shear modulus. It is a shear stress associated with the screw axes in cylindrical coordinates. They all have a 1/r the r gets smaller and strains and stress become infinite, and therefore it is not linear (the assumption breaks down). As you get closer to the dislocation line, it breaks down, physicall curve in green around the screw dislocation.

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2010.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2010.png)

Stress field again 1/r singularity for both types of dislocations.

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2011.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2011.png)

In practice they do far field calculations, and nanometer from the dislocation (around 30 atoms) within that range linear elasticity breaks down. This is called the core region, atomistic calculations to find out the stress field. Sign flip and passes at the origin where the dislocation is placed. 

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2012.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2012.png)

The negative sign the compression occurs where the extra half-plane is while the tensile occurs where the half-plane is missing. 

# Lecture 2: Thermodynamics of dislocations

## The energy of the dislocation

Sum of the strain energy and we have to contemplate both types of energy: the elastic component and the core component. 

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2013.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2013.png)

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2014.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2014.png)

Where **G** is the shear modulus of the material; **b** is the Burger Vector; **L** length of the dislocation, R distance to the edge of the crystal, or to the nearest adjacent dislocation; r0 is the core region (basically where the linearity breaks).

Some key points

- The energy is proportional to the length of the dislocation, and this favors linear dislocations (vs. curved ones)
- The edge dislocations cost more energy when analyzed per unit length
- There is a large penalty for large Burger's Vector therefore "they try to be" as small as possible, usually 1
- The stresses associated with each type of dislocations are orthogonal to each other, so we can separate into different components (similar to shear and normal stress)

## Thermodynamics of dislocations

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2015.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2015.png)

How many dislocations are thermodynamically stable. The energy penalty is very high. The characteristic energy is not even close to the energy of dislocations (0.05 eV). When we plug the huge delta G gives us a very small number like -650 dislocations per mol. So we do not expect dislocation at equilibrium. This is different from point defects that are expected at equilibrium, dislocations are not.

So why are they there? but kinetically they are very hard to remove.

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2016.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2016.png)

All of these defects create tensile or compressive forces within a crystal and this in turn will affect how the crystal structure will move when they a force is applied.

## Interfaces

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2017.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2017.png)

Grain Boundary - two of the same crystal lattices but orient differently.  A twin boundary is like shearing the crystal, mirror image to one another but the lattice spacing is similar. 

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2018.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2018.png)

Grain boundary at a low angle. Treat it as one crystal as if joined by edge dislocations to accommodate the tilt angle. D is reduced when more dislocations are added. We can approximate the energy penalty associated with the dislocations by using the expression found at the beginning of the class of W-dislocation.  

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2019.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2019.png)

There are high and low energy grain boundaries. Mixing low energy, jump, and this creates a faceted grain boundary (TEM).

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2020.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2020.png)

Screw axes in the center of this type of twist grain boundary. This are called sometimes, stack and fold. Same again we can use the energy analyses.

## Category of interfaces

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2021.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2021.png)

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2022.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2022.png)

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2023.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2023.png)

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2024.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2024.png)

When we have mismatching borders we can reduce the amount of energy by placing defects. But at the same time that has an energy penalty and the sum is the red line observed in the graph. 3D volumetric changes in the crystals, especially at a higher temperature because of the vibrations, this has implications in phonons transport.

# Lecture 3: Diffusion and random walk

- Diffusion - random motion of particles leading to a change in concentration profile.
- Random - thermal vibrations give atoms random kicks, this is a Brownian Motion, and the statistic that defines it is Maxwell-Boltzmann
- Inter-diffusion - over time there's mixing of the atoms. The kinetic mechanics that gives rise (thermodynamics gives the driving force for a process to occur, the question whether it occurs or not is a matter of kinetics).

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2025.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2025.png)

One of those mechanisms is vacancy diffusion: atoms exchange with vacancies (substitutional vacancies or through interstitial sites). The rate depend on how many vacancies we have and the activation energy that takes (it can be fast or slow). Temperature will increase the rate. 

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2026.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2026.png)

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2027.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2027.png)

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2028.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2028.png)

Interstitial sites in crystals from 1 to 2 need to push atoms 3 and 4 apart, there is an energy barrier in moving these two atoms.

## Migration barrier

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2029.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2029.png)

In this case, b is the migration barrier between a and c. This type of diffusion needs thermal activation. The flux goes like the frequency of hoping b times e to a Boltzmann factor. This can be separated into the enthalpic and entropic (?) component[.](http://component.Do) D0 is the diffusion coefficient in some specific sets of coefficients. As the temperature goes up it becomes easier.

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2030.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2030.png)

The activation energy for a crystal is higher than a grain boundary, which at the same time dislocation and surface (which is the minimum). We could find a diffusivity for each of these cases, and we can sum it up to separate between the different mechanisms. 

## Random Walk Motion

In theory, we would not be able to tell where the vacancy will move next. But in practice, there are many circumstances when RWM is biased, for example external loading. 

In the end which one is my final position, this is Rn and this is the sum of the individual step vectors. Final vector sum. 

If we want to know how far from the starting point, in this case we would take the magnitude of the vector which is the square root of the dot product of the vector Rn times the vector Rn.    

![Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2031.png](/Module%209%2047cbda498c0946f1a6092e018a00c594/Untitled%2031.png)

(see video for derivation). In polymers this might not be true and coordinate random walk we take into considerations some of the previous step. 

# Lecture 4: Fick’s laws

The diffusion coefficient not a function of time, this might not apply sometimes.

Fick's 2nd law accounts for varying concentration profiles. Concentration gradient we make a first approximation as a Gaussian, normal function. In the sketches. The first derivative is the flux, and the slope is zero at the peak of the Gaussian curve. The second derivative is the rate of accumulation, is negative where the initial concentration the highest, we have the highest to the right and left of the highest peak, where is going to re- aggregate.

See that we do not take the limit to infinitive. The error function of z is define and tabulated.
