I was planning on doing an entire month for my *vitality* category, but I changed my mind. These are the chief pillars for a healthy life and I've been trying to implement them throughout the quarantine with varying degrees of success depending on the week. 

In order not to get too overwhelmed I will add these important having in pairs every week. I have a small headstart, as my yoga practice is well established already (Ashtanga Primary Series 5 times a week) and, I've been meditating on and off. 

### Week 29 & 30 (Thursday 14th to Sunday 26th of July)
* Meditation 30 min a day
* Sleeping before 10.30 pm
