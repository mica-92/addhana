# Crystallography


**BOOK:** *Introduction to Crystallography*, Sands (1975); *Crystallography and the World of Symmetry*, Chatterjee (2008)

# Crystal Structures

**Crystallography** is the study of the structure and properties of the crystalline state. 

- A **crystalline material** is one in which the atoms are situated in a repeating array over large atomic distances. Two characteristics: long-range order and periodicity. An a**morphous material** lacks long-range order.
- Crystalline structures are described though the **hard-sphere model**, where atoms are thought of being solid spheres with well-defined diameters.
- The term **lattice** means a 3D array of points coinciding with atom positions. It is a mathematical construct and assumed to be infinite.
- A **unit cell** is chosen to represent the symmetry of the crystal structure wherein all the atom positions in the crystal may be generated by translations of the unit cell integral distances along each of its edges.

## Bravais Lattice

*m in an integer and cos α can only generate values between -1 and 1 so.* From this analysis, we obtain that a 5-fold symmetry in a 2D lattice is not possible.

### Unit Cell

So, a unit cell is the repetitive unit in an infinite lattice. Thus, the unit cell is the basic structural unit or building block of the crystal structure and defines the crystal structure by virtue of its geometry and the atom positions within. It is the highest level of geometrical symmetry, and 3D has a parallelepiped figure. 

There are two main types of cells:

- **Primitive cells -** meaning it only has lattice points at the corners. Sometimes the full symmetry of the system is not shown (as in the case of O.2 in the figure below). When this happens we can choose a non- primitive cell (with an atom in the center or using the **Wigner-Seitz primitive cell.**
- **Non- primitive cells** - each atom does not have the same contribution to the unit cell (the center one is adding 1 while the corner atoms only 0.25 each)

![Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%203.png](/Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%203.png)

*Wigner-Seitz primitive cell*

By altering the axes length (a, b) and the angles (ϑ  and φ), **5 Bravais lattices can be found in 2 dimensions**.

![Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%205.png](/Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%205.png)

**do not form*

### Unit Cell Calculations

When the axes are not in right angles from one another we have to use the following equations

![Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%207.png](/Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%207.png)

### The 14 Bravais Lattices

When dealing with 3 dimensions, apart from the primitive unit cell there are

- Symbol P - Primitive with only corner lattice points
- Symbol A - face-centered in the a-axes
- Symbol B-  face-centered in the b-axes
- Symbol C - face-centered in the c-axes
- Symbol F -  face-centered in all axes
- Symbol I - body-centered

The unit cells are the building block of the three-dimensional patterns, that is, space lattices. They are characterized by relations between the axial lengths known as unit translational vectors and the angles between them. It is more convenient to express these edge distances of the unit cells as vectors and so they will henceforth be noted as unit translational vectors: a, b, and c and the angles between them as α, β, and γ.

![Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%208.png](/Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%208.png)

![Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%209.png](/Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%209.png)

Now as there are seven numbers of crystal systems and there are six numbers of different lattices that could be constructed by assigning additional lattice points like P, A, B, C, F, and I, so it might be possible to find 42 (6×7) different types of space lattices. But we get actually only 14 numbers distinctly different lattices known as Bravais lattices.

Any additional lattice other than these 14 in number is a repetition of any one of the existing lattices. 

![Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2010.png](/Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2010.png)

![Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2011.png](/Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2011.png)

# Symmetry

Two bodies or configuration of bodies (i.e., Pattern) may be called symmetrical if and only if they are indistinguishable in all respect. The symmetry operations are those operations which when performed on a pattern, the pattern returns back to its state of self-coincidence or invariance.

An object or figure is said to have symmetry if some movement of the figure or operation on the figure leaves it in a position indistinguishable from its original position.

### Proper Rotation

![Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2012.png](/Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2012.png)

In H20 the 180° rotation about the bisector of the H-O-H angle is a symmetry operation, and the rotation axis is a symmetry element. This particular symmetry element is designated by the symbol C2 in the Schoenfties notation used extensively by spectroscopists, or simply by the symbol 2 in the Hermann-Mauguin or international notation preferred by crystallographers.

**The symmetry element for which the operation is a rotation of 360/*n* is given b the Schoenfties symbol Cn (or the Herrmann-Mauguin symbol n).**

### Mirror plane/ Reflection

![Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2013.png](/Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2013.png)

![Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2014.png](/Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2014.png)

![Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2015.png](/Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2015.png)

![Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2016.png](/Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2016.png)

**The Herrmann-Mauguin symbol for a mirror plane is m. In the Schoenflies notation, the symbol α is used with subscripts to indicate the orientation of the plane with respect to any rotation axes present [αh horizontal mirror plane (2.4); αv is a vertical mirror plane (2.5); αd is a diagonal mirror plane (2.6)]. The identity (C1 or 1)  is the 360 rotation, it is always present.**  

### Center of Symmetry

![Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2017.png](/Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2017.png)

Another symmetry element that occurs frequently is a center of inversion or center of symmetry. This symmetry element is a point, and the operation consists of inversion through this point. A straight line drawn through the center of inversion from any point of the molecule will meet an equivalent point at an equal distance beyond the center.  **The center of inversion is denoted by the Schoenfties symbol i or by the Herrmann-Mauguin symbol T.**

### Improper Rotation

**In the Schoenflies system, an improper rotation axis, Sn, is an axis of rotatory reflection, and the operation is a combination of rotation by 360/n followed by reflection in a plane normal to the Sn axis.** It is very important to understand that this definition does not necessarily imply the existence of Cn and **α**h individually. The operation is a combination of the motions of Cn and **α**h. An equivalent point is not generally reached after the C, operation alone or after the **α**h operation alone, but only after both motions have been carried out.

**In the Herrnann-Mauguin notation, an improper rotation axis is an axis of rotatory inversion. The operation here is a combination of rotation by 360/n followed by inversion through a point, and the symbol is ñ.** Again, the operation consists of a combination of motions, and ñ does not necessarily imply the existence of either a proper rotation axis, n, or a center of inversion.

![Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2018.png](/Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2018.png)

See that although the operation is the same they are defined differently. 

![Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2019.png](/Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2019.png)

![Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2020.png](/Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2020.png)

![Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2021.png](/Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2021.png)

![Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2022.png](/Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2022.png)

To conclude the macroscopic symmetry elements that may occur without repetition in space lattices are:

- Rotation Axes: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6
- Center of symmetry: 1
- Rotation Inversion Axes: 3, 4 and 6
- Mirror plane: m (2)

Note that 1-, that is one-fold rotation and inversion is the same as the center of symmetry, and 2-, that is two-fold rotations and inversions is also the same as the mirror plane, they are not included as separate symmetry elements in space lattice. 

**The combination of these create the 32 point groups**

## Microscopic symmetry elements in crystals

In addition to these symmetry elements there are two more symmetry elements that are related to the detailed arrangements of motifs (atoms or molecules in actual crystals). These symmetry elements are known as microscopic symmetry elements, as they can only be identified by the study of internal arrangement of the motifs. As X-ray or electron diffraction can reveal the internal structures, these symmetry arrangements can only be identified by X-ray, Electro or Neutron diffraction. Obviously, they are not revealed in the external shape of the pattern. These symmetry elements are classified as microscopic symmetry elements. There are two such types of symmetry elements: (i) glide plane of symmetry and (ii) screw axis of symmetry.

### Glide plane

It is a combination of reflection and translation of the motif. The translation associated with the glide plane may be one of the following:

- One half of one of the unit translational vectors, that is, a, b, and c, which define the unit cell
- One half or one quarter of the face diagonal

![Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2023.png](/Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2023.png)

### Screw Axis of Symmetry

It is the combined effect of rotation and translation, which transforms the array of motifs into self coincidence. The rotation axis is known as screw axis of rotational symmetry or simply screw axis of symmetry.

![Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2026.png](/Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2026.png)

![Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2028.png](/Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2028.png)

To conclude the microscopic symmetry elements that may occur without repetition in space lattices are:

- Rotation Axes: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6
- Center of symmetry: 1
- Rotation Inversion Axes: 3, 4 and 6
- Mirror plane: m
- Glide plane: a, b, c, n, d
- Screw axis: (eleven total see table)

**The combination of these create the 230 space groups**

## Point Group

The collection of symmetry elements possessed by a molecule is called a **point group.**

**The point group of symmetry of a crystal is that collection of macroscopic symmetry elements (that is not taking into consideration glide planes and screw axis)** which occurs at every lattice point of the space lattice of the crystal taking into consideration that point group of a lattice may be different from the point symmetry of the actual crystal itself as a consequence of the shape of the motif (atoms or molecules).

## Space Groups

**The space group of a crystal is the collection of symmetry elements (macroscopic and microscopic) which, when considered to be distributed in space according to the Bravais Lattice, provides knowledge of total symmetry present in the crystal amongst the different array of atoms or molecules within it.**

![Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2033.png](/Crystallography%20fa287e04c4614d6097dd554ef0eac869/Untitled%2033.png)

# Crystallographic planes & Miller Indices

A plane is indexed (hkl) according to its normal direction [hkl]. These indices are given to a plane by the following procedures:

(a) Measure the intercept that the plane makes on the axes of the lattice

(b) Divide the intercept by the appropriate unit translation

(c) Invert the dividends

(d) Rationalize the inverted dividends

(e) Place the rationalized numbers in round brackets

Figures 2.9 and 2.10 explain the procedures as mentioned above.

The sets of planes (hkl) are noted by {hkl}. The {110} family of planes comprises six planes, that is, (110), (101), (011), (1¯1¯0), (1¯01¯), and (01¯1¯). The bars as usually signify the intercept in the negative side of the axes. All these planes belong to the same class and together they are represented by {110}
