Growing up, the way my parent's house looked was always a source of stress for me. I was never comfortable. Bringing friends was an avoid-at-all-cost-task. Nothing ever seemed to have a place and stuff just pilled everywhere. Although I won't get into too much detail, I now can understand how that happened (but I do struggle to see how it can still be going on). 

So, as soon as I moved with Ted I wanted to avoid all the mistakes I felt my parent's made in their own space. I wanted our apartment to be the center of all family reunions and study meetings. And that I did. For 2 years we got the most out of our small space while receiving multiple compliments on how it looked. 

I give partial credit to both Marie Kondo's books, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22318578-the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up">*The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up*</a>, and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25614984-spark-joy">*Spark Joy*</a>. Concise and to the point, in less than 500 pages they taught me how to keep things simple and functional around the house. And now that I'm moving they seemed a great guide to help me once more with decluttering and organizing our belongings.

## Book notes and insights:
* Discard first, organize later. I've seen myself already fail at this axiom. After doing a decent job on packing and donating kitchen items, my wardrobe probe to be a tougher contestant.   
* Every time ask yourself: **does it spark joy?** 
* We should be choosing what we want to keep, not what we want to get rid of.
* The best sequence is this: clothes first, then books, papers, *komono* (miscellany), and lastly, mementos.
* Two very important maxims: **don’t let your family see** (i) and **what you don’t need, your family doesn’t either** (ii).
* We need a quiet space to evaluate the things in your life.
* **Every object has a different role to play and a lesson to teach, once the task is fulfilled we should let go**. To truly cherish the things that are important to you, you must first discard those that have outlived their purpose.
* **Everything has to have its designated spot**. Plus two rules: store all items of the same type in the same place and don’t scatter storage space. Clutter is caused by a failure to return things to where they belong. Therefore, storage should reduce the effort needed to put things away, not the effort needed to get them out.
* **Never pile things**
* Storage four principles: fold it, stand it upright, store in one spot, and divide your storage space into square compartments.
* Two habits I would like to integrate: I. Empty my purse/backpack every day; II. Connect/ greet your home. The latter resonates with me a lot because when I was a kid, my mother, sister, and I sang every time we arrived home. Just thinking about this memory brings warmth to my heart. 
* Letting go is even more important than adding.
* Tidying is the act of confronting yourself; cleaning is the act of confronting nature. Said differently: tidying orders the mind while cleaning purifies it.
* The 90% storage rule -  full drawers but not stuffed. 

<h2>Things that spark joy soak up precious memories</h2>

## The six basic rules of tidying
1. Commit yourself to tidy up
2. Imagine your ideal lifestyle
3. Finish discarding first
4. Tidy by category, not by location
5. Follow the right order
6. Ask yourself if it sparks joy

## Spark Joy: tips
* If unsure compare.
* Start with objects that are close to your heart.
* Feelings of fascination, excitement, or attraction are not the only indications of joy. A simple design that puts you at ease, a high degree of functionality that makes life simpler, a sense of rightness, or the recognition that a possession is useful in our daily lives—these, too, indicate joy.
* When we do feel torn about something, there are three possible reasons: the item once brought us joy but has fulfilled its purpose; it does bring us joy but we don’t realize it, or we need to keep it regardless of whether or not it sparks joy.
* The essence of the storage process is to appreciate the things you own and to strive to make your relationship with them as special as possible.

## Tidying-up Categories
### Clothes
#### Order:
* Tops (shirts, sweaters, etc.)
* Bottoms (pants, skirts, etc.)
* Clothes that should be hung (jackets, coats, suits, etc.)
* Socks
* Underwear
* Bags (handbags, messenger bags, etc.)
* Accessories (scarves, belts, hats, etc.)
* Clothes for specific events (swimsuits, kimonos, uniforms, etc.)
* Shoes

#### Folding
* The key is to store things standing up rather than laid flat.
* Look for the rectangle. 
* The Spark joy illustrations are the best :)

#### Hanging
* Some things are just happier hanging. These include coats, suits, jackets, skirts, and dresses.
* Arrange your clothes so that they rise to the right. Also, hang heavy items on the left side of the closet and light items on the right. Heavy items include those with length, those made from heavier material, and those that are dark in color. As you move toward the right side of the closet, the length of the clothing grows shorter, the material thinner, and the color lighter. By category, coats would be on the far left, followed by dresses, jackets, pants, skirts, and blouses.

#### Other notes
* **Avoid the loungewear category** 
* My number one KonMari sin - Never, ever tie up your stockings. Never, ever ball up your socks.
* The trick is not to overcategorize. Divide your clothes roughly into “cotton-like” and “wool-like” materials when you put them in the drawer.

### Books
For me, the magic solution to the book problem and the one method I've been implementing is own a Kindle. 
I know... nothing replaces the texture of paper and the connection one makes with a physical book, but not having to worry about space, cleaning, and other nuances associated with bookshelves is well worth it. I now own only a handful of books in physical form and for very particular reasons. 

### Paper
**Rule of thumb—discard everything**
Distribute all college material after the final exam has been given

### Komono
* Skincare products & makeup- Not a big problem
* Accessories - This is a cumbersome category and one I am not looking forward to tackling. 
* Anything that seems vaguely “electric” - There's room for improvement in this arena.
* Household equipment - In my case, this is mainly stationary and writing goods and, crochet supplies and shopping bags. The latter is the family's karma. 
* Kitchen - The three main categories of kitchen komono are implements for eating, cooking tools, and food.

## Japanese culture
* *Yaoyorozu no kami* (800.000 gods)- three facets to the spirit that dwells in material things: the spirit of the materials from which the things are made, the spirit of the person who made them, and the spirit of the person who uses them. The spirit of the maker has an especially powerful impact on an object’s personality. Yet, in the end, it is the feelings of the person who uses an object, the way in which he or she treats it, that will determine what kind of aura it has (kuki-kan “feeling of the air”). 
* *Mono no aware* - “pathos of things,” describes the deep emotion that is evoked when we are touched by nature, art, or the lives of others with an awareness of their transience. It also refers to the essence of things and our ability to feel that essence.
