Since Ted told me he was coming to Buenos Aires I made a list of my favorite spots in my neighborhood, La Lucila. Almost a week into our Buenos Aires adventure (or how we call it, Chapter 6) this is how out list is going

Best fabrica de pasta – La Imperial. Glorious ravioli and fetuccini we (Ted) cooked to my family

Best medialunas – La de Vicente López. Service was okay, but oh my God those buttered medialunas are always the best

Best chipa – La Espiga de Oro. First stop my parents did after we got off the plane

Best ice cream – Veikko. Out of words to describe the best ice cream in the planet and they change their flavor selection almost everyday

*I’m happy to share that he loved this places as much as I do
