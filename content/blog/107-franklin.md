As I observe Franklin every day, I wonder how something with such a strong character -with defined tastes and ways of communicating what he wants- not to be conscious? 

For me, Frankie presents all the attributes by which I believe there's a Mica. I have a distinct personality, erratic and highly emotional, and ways of expressing to the world who and how I am. And Franklin does too. His toolbox is different than mine. He is calm, hardly ever barks, loves pillows and sleeping with his head placed on one, he likes being with humans, and while he is sitting with you, he wants you to want to use your arm as a pillow. Even his learning ways isn't so different from mine: he gets treats, I get ~~As~~ Bs. What is missing that would allow me to describe him as a conscious being? Speech? Or just some way of him manifesting that he believes there's a Franklin sleeping on the couch?

This is probably a long introduction to post some beautiful pictures of <i>my little Buddha</I>. He's been with us for a year and a half and has managed to make our routine life magical -and provide a great excuse to leave the house while the strict quarantine was in place in Argentina. We love you <i>chanchito</I> üê∑.
