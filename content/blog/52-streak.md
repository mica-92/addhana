<h2> … and 5 thoughts on intermittent fasting (IF)</h2>

* I.F. really help with my morning-crush. When I’m not fasting, after breakfast I experience low energy where I could think of is crawling back to bed. IF has really helped me with the morning crush, allowing me to be more productive and have a more energy-stable day
* Because I break my IF with a big healthy lunch, I’m less incline to take little snacks through out the day (although yesterday after a toxic conversation with my grandmother I ate half a carrot budín).
* I love how my days are now divided in 2 parts: fasting and eating. It does feel like a fresh start after lunch.
* I’m starting to enjoy taking care of lunch and cooking the first meal of the day.
* I’m not a entirely sure that I would be able to do it without the mate as beverage throughout the fasting period
