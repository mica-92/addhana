In another chapter of Mica-Designs, a fellow graduate student ask me to help her design a logo for raising funds for a Hurricane Relief Fund for Central America.

I've been working on and off with these ones for the past couple of weeks, not really knowing what Nati wanted or finding sources of inspiration on Google. These are the ones I ended up picking for her :)
