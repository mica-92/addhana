*And they called off the circus, burned the disco down*

*When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns*

*I'm still on that tightrope*

*I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me*

*And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why*

*I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try*

*I'm still on that trapeze*

*I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me*
