Yesterday I (finally) graduated from college. After years of hard work with countless hours with my butt in the chair and my nose between textbooks, I made it over 5 years of intense work, all summarized in a <a href="https://youtube.com/c/micaninni">40-minute presentation</a>.

Many of my close friends gathered to see the whole thing unfold in youtube, and reading their comments and feeling their virtual presence had a nice comforting sensation in a time where the sense of isolation is the new norm.

My love-hate relationship with social media is well known, and I was a little reticent at first to post on Instagram about it. But thank god I did. I received so many messages from people that at some point were part of my life but fell apart for different reasons. It was nice to take the time to answer every single one of them, and see how they were doing, what they were up to, and how they are handling growing pains.

The degree was awesome (and I’m happy with the achievement) but it’s true what they say, everything is ten times better when shared.
