Like every Tuesday morning, yesterday I woke up early, kiss Frankie, and after an hour of journaling, I went grocery shopping. 

But, unlike every other Tuesday, Blanca’s vegetable store was closed. 

This minor setback disrupted my entire shopping experience. I was so upset. In my head, all there was were thoughts about how dare they close without letting me know and how I should probably start looking for a new vegetable place. It was all about how unreliable they were and how they didn’t provide delivery services (in this COVID times!). How the day before because I arrived too early, they refuse to take my vegetable request. I then proceeded to walk half a block to a smaller verduleria. Just to discover they didn’t have avocados, broccoli, or the type of lettuce I like, criolla, so I ended up buying capuccina. I returned home annoyed and frustrated about feeling my daily tasks had been a failure. 

I could later realize, that underlying all the uneasiness there was a strong sense of attachment. I wanted things to go my way and I lacked the sense of control developed through routines. 

I know I’m leagues away from enlightenment but there is a small comfort in understanding a little bit better my mind’s inner workings.  

*But.. we can breath. I went back this morning and it was open.*
