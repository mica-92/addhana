Holidays like Día de los muertos (Halloween) make me feel an outsider of my own species.

Is not that I don’t like going out, but I just don’t feel such a strong feeling to connect with the masses in these kind of commercial holidays, probably just using them as an excuse to either eat a bunch of sugar in the form of hard candy or get dressed in an unusual, weird ‘likely to be regretted a couple of years from now’ way, and get drunk.

For me Día de los muertos symbolized going to bed at 11 after going for a walk and stopping at an ice cream parlor in 5th Avenue.
