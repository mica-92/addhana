One final resolution I sat for 2020 was to upgrade my professional information. For this, I create a <a href="http://researchgate.net/profile/maria_ninni">Research Gate</a> and <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/mninni">LinkedIn</a> account, make available to the world my undergrad-senior thesis, and update my CV with a profile section (+ try to make it bulkier with some minor recent accomplishments). 

Little would I've known that my résumé's final version will evolve to be a personal website. The thoughts behind this crazy endeavor lay in the fact that developing my professional website will give lots of room to explore and share my research and other professional interest with everyone while being detached from the social media standards and recipes. 

At first sight, it does not look like an academic website. The colors are a little too much on the dark side of the spectrum, the layout is not the classical one, and it does not shout what I do for research (the back movie is a glacier moving). Still, I am super happy with it and is always fun to challenge myself with some programming challenge -although I felt that writing the different sections was more challenging than the website itself haha.

Now the real deal is to keep it updated. Hopefully, I do a better job than the one I do with my blog (but that's about to change). <br><br>
