<cite>A perfect image of my mind today</cite>

Today’s morning was one of THOSE morning. You know, those type of mornings (sometimes it can last the whole day) where no matter what you are doing, you could always be doing something better.

When I was journaling, I wanted to study High Valyrian

When I was learning High Valyrian, I wanted to be at the 9am yoga class

When I decided I was not going to yoga in the morning but rather leave it for the afternoon, I wanted a coffee

Went to Oxxo to purchase my coffee (plus almond Sneaker bar too, together with a great sense of guilt), just to realize that what all I really wanted was fruit (half of the coffee is still in the fridge)

Came back from the fruit stand and ended up drinking mate

In the mean time, thinking I should be: meditating, working, studying, grocery shopping, blogging, learning Latin or Dothraki, eating pizza, calling my mum, supervising the construction site next door; basically, doing anything except what I was doing at that precise moment.

Very mindful.

And the big question is WHY? Why do I pay attention to myself on days like this? My conscious ‘I’ was acting like a spoiled little prick wanting, wanting, wanting; while the ‘me’ was trying to please this never- ending demand for random wants, camouflaged as needs.

Eventually it stopped, the brain does get tired sometimes and noon was approaching. But next time I’m doing what every parent should do when their kids are acting like that… not pay attention to them (in the end is all they are seeking) and let them cry, frustration is also part of growing up.
