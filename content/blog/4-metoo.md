Every night when I go to bed I kiss my boyfriend goodnight, look at him in the eyes and tell him ‘I love you, baby’, After what follows complete silence.

It’s been a little bit less than 2 months since I made that first statement driving through Virginia the day I decided I was going to loose my flight ticket to explore the perks of living in Mexico with someone I met on a plane. I don’t believe in the social convention that feelings (or in this case the words I love you) should be said on the twenty- third date, with a quarter full moon, on an even numbered street, and only just ONLY if the other person said it first. For me it goes smoother, if you are feeling something and you are, both of you are, committing, just say it.

Love is a feeling but is also a choice. It involves many sensations, thoughts and dedication; and although is perceived differently in every relationship, I’m still pretty convinced that this is a very close call. As Alan Watts expresses in his book ‘The Wisdom of Insecurities’ words are fixed conventions to explain the flux that surrounds us; so in this sense, saying I love you, is just the closest word you found to express the synergy that’s going inside you.

Is not that I’m waiting to listen to that ‘Me too’, but in a way I am. And I always wonder why do I do this? What kind of relief I’m expecting to obtain from this small statement, that even though is not verbalized I feel it every day anyway? Is it for ego? for security? There is a huge act of selfishness in such a premise; as I do not need to hear that to know that in his own way he is experiencing what we mundanely call love. And in a way, not having heard that ‘me too’ yet and noticing how he talks about his feelings in a dropper-ish manner, makes me want to be worthier of those precious words and take a higher value in the love I receive everyday.

So tonight, as every night, when I go to bed I’ll kiss my boyfriend goodnight, look at him in the eyes and tell him ‘I love you, baby’, without expecting those words, just knowing the ‘Me too’ was present through out the day in our morning coffee, in our lunch routine and our mimitos in bed.
