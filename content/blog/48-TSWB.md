This quarantine was all about happiness, self- improvement, and habits. Yesterday I officially completed Yaleâ€™s most popular class ever and my 2nd (actually 3rd) Coursera course during the COVID19 lock-down, The Science of Well-Being.

I enjoyed the course so much, that I enrolled in the UPenn Foundations of Positive Psychology Specialization and already audited Part I. It is a long course lasting a total of 10 weeks, I manage to complete it in 5 weeks by bingeing the first week through all the lectures and leaving the last 4 weeks for the Final Reweirement Challenge.

The course is a journey through the most recent scientific breakthroughs regarding the science of happiness and positive psychology. From finding your signature strengths to measuring your happiness (link), thereâ€™s a lot of self- discovering involved and understanding of why happiness seems so elusive in our modern world.

With no mandatory reading or hand- in assignments, itâ€™s really up to you to do the recommended activities and have fun putting the new knowledge into practice.

My final rewirement was meditation (half an hour to an hour sit every day), and Iâ€™m happy to say the course really helped to renew my commitment to the practice. In the last couple of weeks, my cushion-assistance was 78%, and my happiness went up 0.3 points, way more than what I expected!. Results are not only theoretical but visible, I believe part of why the quarantine concubinage has been going so well is because Iâ€™ve been more in touch with myself and therefore less roller-coaster-ish with my emotions.

All in all, I canâ€™t wait to see if these results are sustained in the upcoming months, considering all the big changes and challenges that await me in the near future.
