Moving is an imminent fact, and therefore the "home & clutter" category seemed a great place to start my happiness project. Moving is not a minor activity, research cited it as the most stressful life events. But we run with an advantage, we are moving to a completely different country, time zone, and hemisphere, so decluttering and picking up the essentials is a top priority. But apart from the physical objects, because we won't be living in Argentina for the next 4 years taking care of the emotional aspect is also tectonic.

The time allocated for this endeavor is 3 weeks. 

## Main points:

* Deep-cleaning Mondays.
Full kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom cleaning and organizing.

* One-minute actions.
If something can be put away or be done is less than a minute, I should be done without delay. 

* Categorize possesions.
4 categories: trash, donate, keep, and take. I need to be highly selective of the last two categories as we do not want to pay for extra weight. And remember, if I do not want it, nobody probably does, meaning do not transfer my trash 

* Closet.
My wardrobe needs a full makeover. I've been getting rid of clothes, shoes, and other garments since January but I need to make an effort to take only what's necessary for this new life-chapter. Graduate schools sound like a big step towards adulthood and without losing my style (if I have any) I should start dressing more accordingly.

* Make the most out of these next weeks.
We won't be back for a while and taking a time to appreciate all the shops and places that served us so well these past couple of years is important. Two resolutions here: take pictures of all our landmarks stops and go on more walks through the neighborhood (3 times a week for at least 40 minutes).

* Family.
Ever since I found out I've been accepted I wanted to spend as much time with my family as possible and COVID has been a pain in this regard. The strict quarantine and the fear of getting my grandparents or any other member sick has made it almost impossible to have many face-to-face interactions. Nevertheless, I need to make take this time to be with them.
