<cite>The Moment</cite>

The memory of the first time I thought ‘There might be something here’ is still crystal clear in my mind. It was an afternoon, after our half- failed Appalachian hiking, we both were reading minding our own business but being there for each other. I was with my Kindle with ‘Eating animals‘, he was with his hardcover of ‘Why Buddhism is True‘. I was laying on the couch, he was sitting on the floor. The mate has been passing around for an hour or so. I remember I stopped reading because my phone had rang, a text message, lifted my head from the screen and looked at him, and that moment became infinite. I took a picture to send my friend back at home who was wondering what was I doing, he was too immerse in his book to realize what was going on, but for me it was one of those few times where in a way you become illuminated. Where your whole life, everything, makes sense so you could live that instant and feel that peaceful sensation, that extreme sense of well-being.

I had a couple of those moments before, and its their essence of being so rare that makes you treasure them and recall them in such a detailed way. These moments, in my experience, don’t show up to tell us ‘he is the one’ (obviously try to stick with the person that shares them with you) but rather to show us how we are capable of feeling, how we want to feel and be. That the inner peace we sometimes seek so much (with yoga and meditatation) can exist in the least expected ways. So, they are not so much about the other person but about us; they appear to show the ‘right’ direction for ourselves.

No, I did not had one of those moments today, but we did went for a coffee and that memory hit me once again. On a time where everything (social media, advertisement, mails, etc) is trying to steal our attention and time, I become an observant of a silent type of togetherness. The same togetherness we had that August afternoon; where there’s no need to do anything, where the other person is not trying to be the object of focus, but just sharing that moment with you in a tacit manner, each on our thing.
