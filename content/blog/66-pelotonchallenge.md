Moving to the States is exciting for several reasons: Christmases are going to be snowy, and Thanksgiving dinners will have turkey again. But most importantly the amazing world of online shopping will be at our feet and God Iâ€™m looking forward to it. 

With the COVID situation and the unsafeness associated with close contact activities, we decided the first purchase to be a peloton bike. But in order to make things a little bit more fun, we decided to add a small challenge. Each of us needs to achieve a 100-day healthy meal streak, meaning no sugar, flour, or dairy. 

Today Iâ€™m starting my second try, as I lost my 11-day streak after visiting my grandparents and succumbing to a bite of my homemade cinnamon rolls. This time Iâ€™ll try to implement a different set of strategies to achieve this. I know I have two main obstacles ahead: my birthday and my momâ€™s with plenty of cake particularly on the second one (I helped to choose most of the flavors). 

The new strategy Iâ€™ll be exploring is the WOOP analysis. It is a visualization technique where you visualize and phrase in short sentences your: wish, outcome, obstacles, and plans to achieve a specific goal. The practice can be performed as many times as needed (between once a day to a couple of times per week). Its core idea to not only think about the final destination but all the difficulties we might encounter to get there. 

So the plan is WOOP every other day in the morning (Iâ€™ll track it with loop). Evaluate if this system works for me. And see if I can go 100 days without a cheat meal.

Wish me luck ðŸ™‚

## WOOP

W â€“ 100-day healthy meal streak

O â€“ feeling better, living longer, happier life

O â€“ birthdays and sweet craving

P â€“ reminding myself this is something I choose and that thereâ€™s a Peloton at stake. Also that this is something not just for me but for us, thereâ€™s accountability in failing
