<cite>Downward facing dog?</cite>

Today was a good days in many ways. I gave my first Spanish lesson, I’m seeing some extraordinary progress in my English student, tried the recipe for avocado dressing (without the basil), have some beautiful orange flowers in my coffee table, ate an amazing salad for lunch, continue improving on my High Valyrian, meditated (or I’m going to in a couple of minutes), had a breakfast- type dinner, cleaned the house (that’s looking so nice), organized the kitchen shelf, drank mate, tried a piece of plum tart from the bakery shop around the corner, wrote my dad his birthday card, mum sent me pictures of my granddad’s french play, talked to friends.

But today is going to be remember it as the day it happened, and that 2-second event that happened this morning was the one that kept me with an uneresable smile all day.

You are probably asking but… what happened? And the truth is I rather keep that to myself.
