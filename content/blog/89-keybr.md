My typing skills are horrible, and for quite a few months Ted has been emphasizing the importance of developing this skill.
 
A healthy bet has emerged between Ted and I. I need to get to an average of 50 wpm faster than him to 100 wpm typing.

My initial average 26.2 wpm (07/28). Current average 34.3 wpm (08/06) 

The loser has to prepare a fancy dinner.
