Life is a huge decision making process, everything revolving our lives was a decision taken at some point.

A big question is, what degree of freedom we have in our decisions? A few days ago this question was posted on our coffee break, and some people smarter than me stated there is no such thing as freewill, and that in this sense our brain does not really evaluate options, but the decision is already made.

If you ask me, I rather think we do have (a little at least) of freewill due to the probabilistic nature of nature itself; but it is valid argument to say that if you think things might have gone different is because a parameter in the reality of that situation was changed, and how can we change it? You can trace this question back to the infinite (or to the Big Bang) and not find an answer.

Following this line of thinking I realize the brain is a great deceiver. Our mind makes us thing we can rationalize our options to come with the best solution to a problem, when logic seems to indicate that is not true. In a way when we write our ‘pros & cons’, and come with an answer, we are basically wasting out time as the only thing we are doing is reinforcing our unconscious decisions to bring it to the conscious side of the mind, and believe we’ve reached a conclusion and have a decision. And probably not just any decision but the BEST decision we could make.

And that was my existential dilemma of the day.
