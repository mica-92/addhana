![My flowers](/9-abucket.jpg)

‘On Sundays the office is closed’ or so my boyfriend thought one of the first weekends we were at Playa del Carmen. I had woken up early to go to the market to buy groceries and such, when I saw a small stand were they were selling flowers; huge beautiful yellow, white, orange flowers. I thought flowers would make home a much cheerful place to work so I decided to buy flowers for my boyfriend. Got home, put them on a mason jar, wrote a small note and headed to work.

The act of giving Ted flowers appeared as an uninterested act of love, just a nice way to say ‘I hope this flowers make your day a little bit better’, something bright and colorful to look at when the work day becomes dull or boring. But seeing the bucket full of flowers in our coffee table gave me a great sense of joy, provoking a much stronger feeling than the one you usually have by seeing flowers. This called my attention.

It took me a while to realize that flowers act as a reminiscence of home; one of those habits your family has but never truly pay attention as they had always been there. There are always bright, colorful, beautiful, sometimes exotic looking flowers on my parents’ living room and this is because my dad brings my mum flowers every other weekend. My mum, in return, takes such a good care of them; changing their water everyday, getting rid of unnecessary leaves, throwing away the one that are starting to wither, ice cubes in the bucket if the weather is too hot; that the flowers look lovely all the time.

Flowers for me, although I did not noticed when I first bought them, are an analogy for love. They symbolize how to give and maintain love through small acts. I find myself every morning doing the same things my mum does before going to work with her flowers; change their water, get rid of unnecessary leaves, throw away the withered ones and put ice cubes in the water because here the weather is always too hot; and although my parents don’t know it, I found an important life lesson behind their flower routine: work on the things you care the most everyday, because that’s the only way you can make them everlasting.
