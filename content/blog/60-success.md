I recently finished the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-success">Success</a> course offered by Wharton and all I can say are positive things about it. This course was great. The content in itself might not be mind-blowing (at the end of the day we all know that there’s an inner and outer sphere of success), but the exercises provided by Richard Shell, the instructor were poignant. They kept me thinking in these topics even after the lecture was done, and sparked pages of introspection in my morning journal. Hopefully, I’m courageous enough to share some of my inner discoveries in future blog posts.

One of the biggest takeaways came from the first exercise, called the <a href="https://grichardshell.com/book-extras/six-lives-exercise/">Six Lives Exercise</a>. 6-life profiles were presented and the task was to rank them from “most successful” to “least successful” with no ties allowed. So I did. The most striking reflection was how I portrayed my personal story, values, and past experiences into each of these individuals; and how my perception of their success was tainted by these judgments. Few times we reflect upon these notions and they are so important. These are the unconscious drivers of everyday life, to make decisions and pass sentence on other people, being able to see them clearly can prove to be a valuable asset to be less harsh toward ourselves and others.

That being said I believe that one of the reasons why I enjoyed the course so much is because Shell distills Buddhist and Stoic philosophy in his teachings. He has spent his post-undergraduate twenties in monasteries in Sri Lanka and other parts of Asia on a journey of self-discovery. Although he never goes into too much detail of his experience there, it is pretty evident he found what he sought there and this course is his way of encouraging people to explore their inner workings for lasting happiness and content with life. Simply said:
