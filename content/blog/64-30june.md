Today I’m feeling pretty much like Jack Konfield’s book tittle

<h3>After the ecstasy, the laundry</h3>

Or like the fish in the final scene of Finding Nemo, looking around wondering

*“now what?”*

My undergraduate education concluded yesterday (I’m finally a licenciada), and today life’s goes on, with quarantine more strict than ever and lifting the garlands from the floor.

Nonetheless I’ve never felt luckier to be surrounded by so many amazing people. I responded every single message of well wishing reconnecting sometimes with people I haven’t talked to in year.

It was beautiful.

Life is beautiful 💙
