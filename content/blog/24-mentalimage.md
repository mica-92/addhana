Time in Playa del Carmen is coming to an end. The next 10 days are fully occupied with traveling and DIY meditation retreats, so we decided take a day off and give one last visit technology-free visit of the year to our place in the world (La Zebra) .

My inner goal was to try to stay mindful all day (or at least most of it). So here are some mental highlights of the day:

Breakfast was awesome (portions did got smaller since we first started going there) but our delirious conversation of the unconscious, conscious and free will; was the main character of the whole thing.

Then we moved to reading a little bit (‘Bird by bird’ 🐦 is almost done), spending a reasonable amount of time at the ocean, which by the way it was in perfect temperature. Then some more reading sitting under a palm tree, curved in such a way that it created the perfect reading position. Such an agitated day required a nap, so I took it.

The image of the day for me was when I woke Ted from his nap we just sat down there in the sand. I was sitting behind him contemplating the scene. The ocean with the different shades of blue, the sun starting to descend and me seeing it from behind Ted’s curly hair. We must have stayed there 10 minutes, a sense of peacefulness invaded me. I gave him a couple of kisses on the back and after a while we simply decided that was the way we wanted to end our day, and in a way to close this chapter. More adventures await us, but Mexico for now is over.

‘The bike rental closes at 6 should we get going?’

Sure, īlot ūī gaomagon!
