Why am I writing a post a day? I think the best definition I could find was:

<cite>“I want to write down my thoughts somewhere where I won’t be able to loose them or throw them away”</cite>

ecause that’s our tendency as <cite>Homo sapiens</cite>, to project certain perfection or vision of ourselves and see if we can deceive ourselves along the way too.

In that way when a writing is not what we expect, we discard it; when a feeling that is not ‘positive’ or align with the ideal ‘me’ we tend to forget and pretend it was never there in the first place.

Journaling is a way to counter act that. When we re- read a post, memory will instantly transport us back to the moment when we were sitting in the computer writing, struggling to find the right word for that sentence, remembering the noises from the construction site right next door, the cars speeding through 25th Avenue, your boyfriend’s red shirt you were wearing, feel the taste of the coffee you had that morning.

Blogging can become like a time capsule; a perpetual source of information of the past self ready to be opened whenever you feel like knowing where you are standing.
