<cite>“Writing a novel is like driving a car at night. You can only see as far as your headlights go, but you can make the whole trip that way”

E. L. Doctorow – Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott</cite>

And I kinda feel this is how my whole journey will go,

step by step, post by post

or as Anne’s father liked to say bird by bird

as I have never done anything like this before. Neither have a blog or open my mind and heart to an unknown public (even doing this to a known public is hard) but in the end, I’ll probably learn something… probably about me, probably about writing or at least how to open and try manage a blog.

So this is Day 1 of me trying to write a blog post every day, Day 75 of trying to live more mindful life, Day 43 in Playa del Carmen, and Day who-knows-what of my terrestrial existence.
