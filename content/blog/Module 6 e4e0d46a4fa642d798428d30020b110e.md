# Lecture 1: A few last diffraction considerations

Diffraction occurs when interference from the N scattering sites is

constructive at the detector

To determine if this occurs, we need to add the contributions of all N scatterers:

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled.png)

If you look in the real crystal and you could identify the locations of all these atoms in the crystals is the Rⱼ and the Fourier Transform for all the atoms will give you the reciprocal lattice of that crystal.

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%201.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%201.png)

### What determines the intensityty of the diffraction points?

The scattering factor is one of them.

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%202.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%202.png)

This tells us where will they occur, how bright they are and which planes are they associated with. 

### Selection Rules

BBC and FCC we are dealing with non-primitive unit cells, more than one lattice point per unit cell, and because of the spacing of those multiple cells we effectively have multiple planes within a unit cell. **Example:** BBC top or bottom and scatter (with some probability) with the middle plane happens to be exactly λ/2 so it can cancel out certain points that we would expect a primitive to square lattice to produce in the diffraction pattern. Therefore when h + k + l are even we will have diffraction point, if the sums is an odd number no diffraction will occur although we would expect it to occur (because of the interference with the middle plane).

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%203.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%203.png)

For the FCC factor similar things occur. 

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%204.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%204.png)

This are called **non-primitive systematic absences**. And they serve as finger prints for the materials we are analyzing. In the below image: 0 no diffraction pattern, 1 diffraction pattern. The reason why we are keeping track of this 0s and 1s is because of Bragg's Law: Find the increments in theta that we want to see to affiliate the pattern with BCC or FCC. 

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%205.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%205.png)

*Explanation for the table in the image below* - With this information of the diffractogram we still do not know the h, k ,l numbers for each peak . So we look at the **relative peak positions**. The diffractogram gives the information for 2θ, therefore we divide the angle by 2 to obtain the θ. Calculate the sine of θ. If we take the ratio of the different sines, this is the **peak ratio of sineθ/sineθ.**

Once we identify we can go back to Bragg's law and because the planes have been identify we can calculate dₕₖₗ or the interplanar spacing. 

question how did he obtain the information of the sines for the 'theoretical' peak 1 and 2

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%206.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%206.png)

## Reciprocal lattice

 We define k₀ as our incoming wave vector prior to scattering, in practice most of the incoming electrons is not diffracted, it passes through the sample and ends up as a transmitted beam. This beams are called 000 (transmitted beam). 

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%207.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%207.png)

**Ewald** - The reciprocal lattice is also in 3D just as the real crystal lattice but the detector is a 2D slice. 

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%208.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%208.png)

### Identification of Unit Cell

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%209.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%209.png)

Simple Cubic Lattice with a 2 atom basis, where each lattice point is associated with a Cs and a Cl. In order to define it we need 2 basis vector, one associated with the Cl and the Cs.

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2010.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2010.png)

Different values for the atomic scattering.

- Even when the non-primitive systematic absences aren’t an issue (due to different values of f), there are often diffraction points that are much weaker than others due to opposite signs in the structure factor. 

The points have different sized and brightness because the atomic scattering of the atoms will interact with one another. The center point is the brightest because it corresponds to the 000 face. 

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2011.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2011.png)

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2012.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2012.png)

# Lecture 2 - How do we obtain diffraction measurements.

### Method 1

In this system you rotate the sample by θ degrees and the detector by 2θ. Most values of θ will not have constructive interference and eventually a local maximum. Together with Bragg's Law we can calculate lattice parameters according to the distances in the peaks. 

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2013.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2013.png)

### Method 2

The sample, detector and beam are all fixed but multiple wave frequecies. More complecated pattern but useful for determinining orientation of crystals.  

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2014.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2014.png)

### Method 3

This is a poly-crystal technique. Separate domains with different orientations. Braggs' Law is still valid. It gives ring as an answer. 

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2015.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2015.png)

## Where do we get the x-rays from?

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2016.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2016.png)

When you have more than one electron (hydrogen), there will be electron screening. As you go to the valence electrons, the ΔE the core electrons are tight to the nucleus.

**Moseley's law** - empirical. approximate scaling relationships associated with the atomic number. What kinds of energy you expect to see based on transitions, useful for heavier elements (not able to compute form first principles the energy eigenvalues). Killed in WWI

K, L and M refer to the quantum numbers, n = 1, 2, 3. α a jump of 1 and, β a jump of 2.

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2017.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2017.png)

## X-ray sources

- Some elements radioactive decay can be sources of x-ray.
- Bombard a metal with electrons, 30-60 KeV. Electrons are easy to manipulate because they have a charge. This will excite the electrons in the metal and as they relax they will emit radiation. Different distributions of the emitting x-rays according to the metal that you choose to bombard (target metal).

### Argonne National Laboratory

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2019.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2019.png)

## Other types of radiation

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2020.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2020.png)

**Neutrons** do not have an electromagnetic component so they are harder to manipulate. The sources sometimes come from nuclear reactors. They can be emitted with a large range of energy, so it is tricky to obtain the right energy. They penetrate deep, not easily bother by the electrons so they tend to interact more with the nucleus. 

**Electrons** easy to manipulate. The voltages are high but doable in a laboratory settings. Collimate the beams with magnetic fields and they have strong scattering, therefore small penetrations depths. 

Very common. Transmission EM are more complicated than Scanning EM. Collimated beams through the condenser 

Adjust the voltage you can tune the electron wavelengths. 

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2021.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2021.png)

Relativistic speeds? - therefore relativistic effects, γ. Travelling more than half the speed of light (almost 80%). You need corrections tables.  

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2022.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2022.png)

## Electron Microscopy

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2025.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2025.png)

Magnetic lenses and the manipulation of electron beams, similar to optical. The specimen is going to be elongated over some. **Objective lenses**, focus the rays. **Back Focus Plane** the lines crossed over themselves, coming from the 3 different places of the specimen tail, center and head of the arrow. Gathering beams that left the specimen with the same angle, this is also called the **diffraction plane. Select a particular angle of scattering.** Real space, the reverse orientation and size there might be some magnification associated with this process. **Intermediate lenses**, magnification and reverses it again to the original orientation. **Fourier Transform of the specimen**

### Bright- Field Imaging

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2026.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2026.png)

Bright- field imaging = We are blocking everything that scattered at some angle from the specimen. Transmitted un-diffracted electrons.  With no objective aperture lower contrast. 

### Dark- Field Imaging

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2027.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2027.png)

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2028.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2028.png)

Dark- field imaging =  a particular set of diffracted electrons. First image "dirty", second image proper because the incident lamination is tilted

### Selected Area Diffraction

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2029.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2029.png)

Just allow electron through that are associated with one specific spot on our specimen, in this case is the head of he arrow. There are limitations on the size.  

### The Camera Equation

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2030.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2030.png)

Camera Equations- L from the viewing screen and the specimen. For r << L, sin θ ~ tan θ ~ 1/2 tan2θ. λ is determined by the voltage and L is something intrinsic to the microscope itself, the units [A cm]

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2031.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2031.png)

### Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2032.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2032.png)

Beam slightly non- collimated. Gain a little bit of information regarding the 3rd dimensions. 

### High Resolution TEM

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2033.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2033.png)

You use a lot of information diffracted and un-diffracted and phase variations in order to create this field. 

# Lecture 3

## How to identify diffracting planes in practice

Labeling with the Miller indexes the different dots in the pattern. Zone Axes pointed toward the electron gun

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2034.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2034.png)

In practice you'll go to tables for diffraction patterns and you'll look for one that approaches your pattern

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2035.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2035.png)

Left Diagram - Every in this slice will have the same c-axes because of the relationship with 45. Axes orthogonal, equal spacing horizontally and vertically, indicative of 4-fold symmetry

Right Diagram - We do not have 4-fold, we have 2-fold symmetry. Zone axes [011]

Left Diagram - 3 or 6 fold symmetry

Right Diagram - 2- fold symmetry.

## Polycrystalline Indexing

The TEM obtains information from other type of properties (diffractions, scatter of in other directions, electron energies, etc.). 

### Inelastic electron scattering

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2039.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2039.png)

The first two types of inelastic scattering cannot be measure with the apparatus, it is just too small of  quantity. Plasmons can be measure this are due to oscillations in the cloud of electrons. Bremsstrahlung (breaking radiation) an incoming electron close to the core of an atom, excite a core electron and the emission associated with the excitement of that electron. 

![Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2040.png](/Module%206%20e4e0d46a4fa642d798428d30020b110e/Untitled%2040.png)

Separate out electrons from different energies and 'send' them to different locations. How many passed without loosing energy and how many did. The left most peak is very tall, zero lost peak they interacter elastictly. Plasmons free oscillations in the electron cloud; in general yhe palsmon energy will be erelated with the material type that is passing though this can come in units of Np. M2,3 this energy level correpsonds to the excitation of 3p electrons out of the Ni sample. Gain change, fewwer and fewer electrons you change the detector parameters, current (low) to get individual electrons. Over 800 L 1,2,3 2p electrons over the Ni atom.

Characteristic lines associated with every diffraction points, it can help find other axes of symmetry. For all of the diffractions there will be two Kikuchi lines.
