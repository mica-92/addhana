Here's the best description I found on how to write an email to a prospect member of your graduate committee in the middle of a global pandemic:

<p class="right">"Hey I just met you.

<p class="right">And this is crazy.</p>
<p class="right">But here's my number</p>


<p class="right">Committee, maybe?"</p>

But the good news even with all that ackwardness 3 out of 5 have already accepted. One if from New Zealand :) 

I'm counting on you Doug and Ileana! You'll prove to be valuable members on my committee!
