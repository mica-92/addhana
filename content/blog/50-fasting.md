Since Sunday I’ve began intermittent fasting.

I’m using a great app, Zero, to track the 16:8 cycle.

Chores have been distributed the following way during the past couple of weeks of quarantine:

Mica – lunch
Ted – dinner
Since Monday Ted asks me (anxiously) around noon when I’m going to take care of lunch. Because of the 16 hour fast window, lately it has been around 2 o’clock, failing to realize this fundamental truth about our *new* lunch schedule:

<h3>The earlier we have dinner,
<h3>the earlier we will have lunch the following day.
