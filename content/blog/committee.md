Here's the best description I found on how to write an email to a prospect member of your graduate committee in the middle of a global pandemic:

*"Hey I just met you*
*And this is crazy*
*But here's my number*
*Committee, maybe?"*

But the good news even with all that ackwardness 3 out of 5 have already accepted :)

One if from New Zealand. 

Come on Doug and Ileana! You'll prove to be valuable memebers on my committee!
