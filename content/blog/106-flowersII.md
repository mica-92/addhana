A couple of years ago, I wrote, what remains to this day, one of my favorite blog posts of all time, <i><a href="https://addhana.com/blog/9-abucket/">A Bucket Full of Fowers</a></i>. 

A hundred blogs and three years later, flowers remain a small tradition in our apartments. They were for the remainder of our life in Mexico; it continued while in Argentina, and now we pay patronage here in Philly. Flowers still bring me as much joy as ever, and I take care of them with the same devotion, changing their water every day, getting rid of unnecessary leaves, and throwing away the ones starting to wither. No ice cubes necessary at latitude 39.95° N.

In the Philly Chapter, we get our flowers from the Farmer's Market at Clark Park, run by a Mennonite Community.  Every two weeks, Ted buys eggs and a beautiful flower bucket. The flowers are gorgeous in a very natural way. You can see these are real garden flowers, not the ones that are grown in greenhouse gardens. There are different flowers every week—their availability changing with the seasons. 

This realization struck me with a sense of gratitude. In a world where cherry tomatoes are available all year round, such a simple act of genuine acceptance: <i>Just let nature be; she'll always have beautiful things to offer</i>. 

Ornamented cabbage was this week's flower.
