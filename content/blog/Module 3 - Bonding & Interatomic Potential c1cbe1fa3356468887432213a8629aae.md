# Module 3 - Bonding & Interatomic Potential

# **Lecture 1 Notes - Bonding and hybridization**

## Ionic Bonding

- Charge transfer between high and low electronegativity atoms in solids
- +/- charged ions
- Need at least two different elements
- Very strong bonding
- High melting point
- **Increasing R means weaker ionic bond, since centers of charge farther apart. Increasing charge for a given R greatly increases strength of bond**

## Covalent Bonding

- We have electrons sharing one another
- We are dealing with valence electrons
- Directionality - electron density aggregated between the two atoms that are bonding together. Important on polymers
- Non- polar - diatomic molecules the electron density is shared completely, the electrons do not 'prefer' one atom over the other one.
- Polarity - some degree X (is Pauling electronegativity scale, different scale). The more discrepant the difference in the electronegativity of the bonds, the more polar the bond will be (eventually ionic all together).

### Bond Hybridization

- The shapes are coming from assuming the wave nature of electrons (and solving the eigenvalues of the Schrödinger Equation)

- S spherical symmetric shape
- P the two lobes can be oriented in the x, y or z axes
- Hybridization occurs because of **energy minimization**
- Example **sp3** (2s2 + 2p2) promotion of a 2s electron into a 2p and the blending of the electron density from 2s and 2p such that you get 4sp orbit. Common with carbon, center atom small close proximity to one another so they form a tetrahedral that minimized the interaction between the atoms.
- Another sample **sp2** - only 3sp orbitals from the remainder is a normal 2pz. Common in graphene.
- Number of hybrid orbitals = number of mixed orbitals - Not destroying or changing the number if orbitals that are being created.
- Comparing H2O and H2S - we have the same atom arrangement but S>> O

![Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%203.png](/Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%203.png)

The S does not need to hybridize because the atom is way larger and the electrons are not in close contact with one another.

- Higher energy electron orbitals can also become involved: energy minimization leads to complicated hybridization. Involving *d orbitals*

![Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%204.png](/Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%204.png)

### Different types of bonds that form is the covalent scenario and how it relates to e- density and the wave function

- Carbon - Hydrogen bonds

![Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%205.png](/Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%205.png)

- What is going on in the electron cloud? Since electrons are shared in a covalent bond, the strength of the bond depends on the degree of orbital overlap. In QM there is a overlap integral that quantifies the degree of overlap. Affected by proximity and shapes of their orbital
- Two types of bonding
    - Sigma - highest right along the bond axes. Radially symmetric overlap between lobes from one atom to the other, rotation freely . Ethane. They have prefer orientations according to the atoms that are bonded (bulky portions of the molecules can interact with one another to avoid steric hyndrances, gruos on the other side of the bond energy penalties)
    - Pi - overlaps adjacent parallel. Interact laterally instead of axially. Large energy cost for this type of molecules to rotate (break the bond are re-form it).
        - A covalent “double” bond has one σ bond and one π bond
        - A covalent “triple” bond has one σ and two π bonds

Notice that rotation doesn’t affect σ bonds, but it would decrease the overlap for the π bonds => rotation is not allowed (this is important in polymers, and creates issues such as cis/trans configurations)

- QM - when a bond created we are creating a new QM system. Sharing that is going to be subject to SE. Easier to treat molecular orbital (vs. atomic orbitals).

Example 2 H coming together with two 1s states. So same energy and Exclusion principle problem. **Result: The two identical levels must split, with one higher energy than the original level (antibonding orbital, left) and the other lower than the original level (bonding orbital, right)**

![Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%206.png](/Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%206.png)

The number of orbitals is conserved but one is lower energy and the other higher energy. Bonding (in between, electrons here make the bond energetically favorable bc in between), antibonding (associated with electron density outside the intermediate region, electrons here mitigate the tendency to bond) - Bond order

![Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%207.png](/Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%207.png)

H2 has a bond of 1 anything higher than 0 is energetically favorable. For He2 two electrons in the antibonding, no energy benefit in forming the bond. This in principle allows the formation of He+ so bonding order of 1.5

![Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%208.png](/Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%208.png)

B2 order of 1 stable diatomic orbitals. O2 paramagnetic scenario spin coupling in the antibonding orbit. Ne2 as many electrons in bonding and antibonding orbitals.

# Lecture 2 Notes - Other types of bonds and interatomic potential

- QM is still happening in a molecule but it is very hard to solve the equations for these systems (multiple things going on the electrons of the different molecules plus the Coulomb Force of the atom interacting with its own electrons)
- What happens when we have different elements bonding together?

![Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%209.png](/Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%209.png)

Extremely dangerous acid HF. Opposite sides of the periodic table. F very electronegative. 2p lower level than 1s the energy bonding for the other orbitals are below the chart.

- Molecular orbital bonding and antibonding they are skewed closer to the F level, almost a charge transfer it has some features of an ionic bond, 'F is contributing more to the bond'. This is what's happening when two very different electronegative elements.
- Perfectly covalent two of the same elements. XA and XB are the same the difference is 0 therefore 1-1 = 0 % of ionic character. Associated with the concept of **polarity**

![Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%2010.png](/Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%2010.png)

## Metallic bonding

- Easiest bond to understand. Very common.
- Sharing of valence electrons, free electrons along the ion cores. Why metals are conductive and ductility.
- Sea of negative chart electrons.
- They can be strong or weak. Ion core size associated with the Coulomb and its electrons
- Most elements are metals.
- Proxy melting of how strong the bond is.

![Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%2011.png](/Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%2011.png)

## Secondary Bonds

- Order of magnitude lower energy.
- They are very important in polymers (covalent backbone, curve and self-interact via secondary bonds)
- Relative strength, see the behavior as a function of temperature (dissasociate energy)
- N2 triple bonded when you cool this down below 210C formation of a solid crystal. He atoms by themselves below 272 can form a crystal they can interact with one another to form a crystal. The low temperatures not very strong
- HF polar molecule dipole-dipole interactions -83C much stronger than this other forces.
- H bonding H bonded to O, N, F

![Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%2012.png](/Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%2012.png)

### Two types of dipoles

- Permanent separation of charge

![Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%2013.png](/Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%2013.png)

- Fluctuation induced by close proximity of otherwise neutral molecules/ atoms. Happens even in He but if they get close together at some point induce a dipole charge distribution. Shorter range, is quite short range

The net effect of dipole-dipole interaction is to induce correlation and aggregation

![Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%2014.png](/Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%2014.png)

Ideal gas law you are assuming secondary interactions exists. We only assume primary boding exists.

# **Lecture 3 Notes: Toward crystals and
macroscopic properties**

## Bond Energy

- Regardless of the type of bonding, there is always an attractive and a repulsive component that balance one another. **Equilibrium Bond length**.
    - Attractive force between atoms –> bonding. Energy is negative compared to separated atoms
    - Repulsive force between atoms when they get too close – Pauli, exchange-correlation. Very short range. Energy is positive compared to separated atoms
- If only repulsive it would never get below 0 never energetically favorable. All we had EA then we would have atoms that would merge and be infinite together. The sum is the red line that has a minimum energy. E0 bond energy (melt the system getting to dissociate), r0 (equilibrium bond length).
- Any type of bond can be plot in a diagram like this E0 and r0 will be different

![Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%2016.png](/Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%2016.png)

- Force is a negative gradient of energy. So if the negative curve has a minimum the derivative is 0

![Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%2017.png](/Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%2017.png)

## Hook's law

- k stiffness
- Bonds can be thought as a spring model.
- R0 up till that point it can be model as a parabola and approximately as a Hookean spring.
- KB * T is an energy probe the bond energy associated with it.
- Relate the stiffness of K with the macroscopic properties
- When you stretch a material, for sufficiently small deformations you get a linear relationship, relating to K in the bond energy, K is the second derivative of the energy with respect of the distance evaluated at R0. Rough calculation by a macroscopic test of our material
- We heat the system and f the energy in not too large is going to be in the well and eventually melt.

![Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%2018.png](/Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%2018.png)

- Hookean model. Potential energy and you can picture the E1, E2 energy of the atom at increasing temperature and if we increase the value of temperatures these wells are going to become broader. The average value (bond length) does not change the parabola is centered in the R0 and does not move.
- **Right hand plot. Injecting energy in the system vibrating more violently, the average distance is increasing (blue line). Simple way of seeing thermal expansion (this Hookean breaks here).**

## Pair Potential

- Pair potentials capture the energetic of the bonds

![Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%2020.png](/Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%2020.png)

- **Hard Sphere Model** - Treat all the atoms as hard sphere the two different atoms have no interactive energy at all and if they interact they have infinite energy of repulsion.
- **Soft Sphere Model** Some kind of compressive interaction for lengths
- **Ionic Coulomb Model** - Ions can be capture their attractive interactions. You need something to represent the repulsive component.
- **Lennard- Jones** - Both the attractive and repulsive component. Short and long distance according to 6 and 12 powers. Sigma is the collision parameter. Epsilon is E0. Empirical they do not hypothesis about what is happening in the bond (this is different form the Coulomb) done by **curve fitting. Neutral atoms such as He cool temperatures how He atoms aggregates.**
- **Morse -** Similar to the Empirical approach that LJ. Longer distances go to 0 faster than LJ.

- Tabulated coefficient.
- **Bohn - Mayer potential** to indicate the repulsion. Minimum energy value
- **Madelung** tabulated for different crystal symmetries
- Number nearest how many?

- Polymers multiple key temperatures

## What else happens as we move from molecules to larger solids? - Implications for electrical, thermal, optical, mechanical properties

![Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%2023.png](/Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%2023.png)

We have a metal separated by a gas of negative charge electrons so if you are an electrons through this system there is going to be a potential curve when you approach an atom and then swings back up as you get away.

The energy levels that came out of the SE are very sharp. So as we take many atoms and bond them together, united QM system we have to be aware of the Pauling repulsive and how many atoms we can have in the degenerate state.

## Solids

What we observe is the same splitting of energy levels, similar to molecular orbitals (**plot**). We have **bands associated with the energy levels, at the equilibrum aotmic separation. It will only affect the valence electrons.**

Allowed energy bands separated by energy band gaps. These gaps have an important effect whether the material is an insulator ir a conductor. Were we are in the states associated with the element. Jump in energy to the next level, you have to promote the electron for the next energy gap. In metals you have partially filled energy bands, less energy for the previous level.

![Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%2026.png](/Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%2026.png)

Fermi Dirac Distribution - you are stuck with fermions in different QM states. You have the states either occupied with e- or not occupied. Fermi energy is where you would filled up to that point that element band structure at absolute zero.

![Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%2027.png](/Module%203%20-%20Bonding%20&%20Interatomic%20Potential%20c1cbe1fa3356468887432213a8629aae/Untitled%2027.png)

Quantum Dot is so small that is physical constraining the band structure, an assumption of a bulk materials. Sub ten nm crystal you do not get the full band structure the size of the particle itself dictated how big the band size is. That jump is associated with color photon has a color if you remove atoms, you have less splitting larger band gap larger energy to gap and higher frequencies. Size dependency of color.??

# **Thursday's Lecture - Conceptual Discussion**

## Potential Energy Diagram Conceptual Analysis

How does this relate with a spring system.

- Lack of asymmetric nature, symmetric parabola.
- R approaching infinity; U will approach zero
- Position its velocity is zero
- T = 0 kinetic energy is 0 because is the moment of rest.

## Concept Quiz Review

### Question 2

- More electronegativity atoms will pull the hydrogens closer and therefore the angle between the hydrogens (the steric interactions)
- Size and electronegativity are not independent variables

### Question 3

- The only correct answer was: **A double bond has both sigma and pi bonds.**
- I answer that pi requires p orbitals & sigma bonds require s bonds.
- See

    notes

### Question 4

- Ionic bond purely -large electronegativity
- Covalent bond purely -

### Question 5

- Once you are larger than u0, we have a negative potential (therefore an attractive potential)
- The force associated with the U is the gradient

### Question 6

- On average the atoms move slightly apart.
- If it was a linear spring we would not expect to see a coefficient of thermal expansions. A mirror in the interatomic potential will be a coefficient of thermal shrinking.
