*I wish I there was no COVID; I wish there was no quarantine; I wish it hasn’t been extended two more weeks; I wish I had bought a sewing machine a couple of months ago; I wish I could have all the right colors of yarn to crochet all the amigurumi in Pica Pau’s latest book; I wish I would have started learning to weave, now I do not have a loom; I wish I was in Mexico; I wish I was in Malta; I wish I was in the Philippines or maybe Bali; I wish we were already in Philly; I wish I could have been with my grandad in his birthday (May 16th); I wish I can be with my brother in his birthday (June 19th), at least I was able to be with Ted in his birthday (April 29th); I’ll probably be able to be with my mum in her 50th birthday, right? (July 19th); I wish I already graduated from college as I had planned; I wish they would have handed me the thesis corrections; I wish I had the motivation to finish the thesis presentation; I wish I knew if there’s the possibility to defend the thesis online; I wish my advisor or even my graduate school knew what is going to happen during the fall semester; I wish I wasn’t feeling so desolate; I wish I could see the end of this situation soon; anyway I wish, I wish, I wish.*
