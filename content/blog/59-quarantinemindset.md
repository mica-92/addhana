For someone whose first thought in the morning is setting the intention for a mindful day (however that wants to manifest itself that day) I found it fascinating how my mind has been residing in imagination this past couple of weeks. My last post is living proof of that. This quarantine, and the incapacity for action I feel due to the confinement has got me into self-centered loops of thoughts with a pretty obvious theme: **wanting**. I get hooked in all the things I would like to have (and can’t), all the situations I would love to be in (and I’m not), and all the decisions that got me to where I am now (and wish they would have been otherwise). While reflecting upon this in my journal I came to some interesting meditations:

* #1. How populated my thoughts are with notions on me, myself, and I. Predominantly in this spiraling of sensations of *I wish, I want, I would love if*, such as the thoughts expressed in the previous post. But curiously enough I also found them on unexpected places like gratitude journal with ideas like **my** crochet, **my** books, **my** practice, etc.

* #2. How although I’ve been on and off reading about Buddhism and trying to keep my meditation practice for the last two years, certain concepts are still stuck to the intellectual game-play and slip away in the experiential realm. Non-Self and non-attachment just to name two.

* #3. Underneath the uncertainty, discomfort, and grasping there is a deep sense of wanting things to be static and in a specific way (basically, **my** way). Failing to see, yet again, another important Buddhist precept: *impermanence*.
