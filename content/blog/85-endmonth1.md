The first month of the Happiness Project is over. I choose Home and Clutter as my first category because we knew we had to move soon. Now we know for a fact we'll be traveling with Frankie and everything in 12 days! 

I must admit I did not enjoy it as much as I thought I was going to. Going through every room and deciding what to take, what to give, and what to throw was a great source of anxiety. I had to do multiple runs in every set of items to tune more finely these categories, and still, I manage to fill 4 pieces of luggage. I was a little bit disappointed. I thought I had a better relationship with stuff, that freeing my self from things to make space for the new was not going to be as hard as it was. 

The books I picked up weren't as enlightening as I believed either. Two of them, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40712502-the-home-edit">*The Home Edit*</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25111339-the-complete-book-of-home-organization">*The Complete Book of Home Organization*</a>, ended up being a collection of images. They had very little substance about organizing in general, and although the pictures were cute, I rather browse through Pinterest. 

The KonMari Method books are always a great read to refresh the memory of how to declutter and keep the house in order. I tried to give to other books in this same gender a tried, and found them plain and completely un-motivational. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30231806-goodbye-things">*Goodbye, Things*</a> is minimalism to the point of not owning a bed, while <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33296312-the-art-of-discarding?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=q27udHb3vw&rank=1">*The Art of Discarding*</a> you can get everything you need just by reading the index. 

I did love <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28364022-the-curated-closet?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=XeY1ESGQoe&rank=1">*The Curated Closet*</a>. The main problem was that with the pandemic and my life on halt it was pretty much impossible to go through the course, and tips on how to detox your closet pre-moving were lacking. I'm looking forward to doing it once life gets back on track and I actually have somewhere to go and dress up for (I've been only wearing PJ for the last 130-something days). 

Overall, I do not think I made a good job in this area. I feel too much attachment to my belongings. This is partially fulled by the prospect of moving. There's an uncertainty associated with not knowing what I'll need in this new chapter or if I'm going to find (or afford) that piece of clothing or item again. Is silly I know especially since we are moving to the land of consumerism and Amazon. But these unfunded fears are here and, I have to work through them if I do not want to make my parent's mistakes. They say step one is acceptance. So, having said all this, I'll try to go through our possessions one more time before the flight to see if I can release a little bit more load before hitting American soil.
