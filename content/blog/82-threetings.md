<h3>We all need a Auri perspective to life and the world: an open heart to beauty, a willingness to listen and, the selfishness and diligent care of helping people and things to find their appropiate place.</h3>  

> *How terrible to live surrounded by the stark, sharp and hollowness of things that simply were enough? Sitting on the warm, smooth floor of Mantle, Auri shivered at the thought of moving through a joyless world like that. Nothing perfect. Nothing beautiful and true. Oh no. She was too wise to live that way. Auri looked around and smiled at all her luxury. She had a perfect loving leaf and lavender. She wore her favorite dress. Her name was Auri, and it was a shining piece of gold inside her all the time.*
