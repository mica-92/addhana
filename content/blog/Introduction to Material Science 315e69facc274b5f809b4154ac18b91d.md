**Top- Down and Bottom- Up Science**

## Notes

**Material science** involves investigating the relationship that exists between the structures and the properties of materials.

**Material engineering** involves, on the bases of these structure, property correlations, designing or engineering the structure of a material to produce a predetermined set of properties.

The **structure** of a material relates to the arrangement of its internal components. There are several levels:

- **Subatomic structure** - involves electrons, their energies and interactions with the nucleus.
- **Atomic structures** - relates to the organization of atoms to yield molecules or crystals.
- **Nanostructures** - aggregates of atoms that form particles, less than 100nm
- **Microstructures** - elements that are subject to direct observation using some type of microscope.
- **Macrostructure** - structural elements viewed with the naked eye

A **property** is a material trait in terms of the kind and magnitude of response to a specific imposed stimulus. There are 6 categories of properties, for each there is a characteristic type of stimulus capable of provoking different responses.

- **Mechanical properties** - relate to deformation. Elastic modulus (stiffness), strength and resistance to fracture.
- **Electrical properties** - the stimulus is an applied electric field. Conductivity and dielectric constant.
- **Thermal properties -** are related to changes in temperature and temperature gradients. Thermal expansion and heat capacity.
- **Magnetic properties** - the response when a magnetic field is applied. Magnetization and magnetic susceptibility.
- **Optical properties** - the stimulus is electromagnetic or light radiation. Refraction Index and reflectivity.
- **Deteriorative characteristics** - associated with the reactivity of materials. Corrosion resistance to metals.

## The Material Paradigm

The interrelationship among **processing, structure, properties, and performance of materials** may be depicted in linear fashion. The model represented by this diagram has been called by some the **central paradigm of materials science and engineering** and was formulated in the 90's (The term “paradigm” means a model or set of ideas.)

The modified version adds **Reuse/ Recyclability** to include the component of material sustainability.

## Classification of materials

[Material Properties](https://www.notion.so/Material-Properties-2740544d206a467997667aec39cf8a71)

### Metals

- Metals are composed of one or more metallic elements and often also nonmetallic elements in relative small amounts.
- Very order arrangement of atoms
- Dense
- Mechanical properties: stiff, strong, ductile and are resistant to fracture.
- Widespread use in structural applications
- Non- localized electrons: good conductors of electricity and heat, not transparent.
- Some have magnetic properties

### Ceramics

- Ceramics are compounds between metallic and nonmetallic elements; they are most frequently oxides, nitrides, and carbides.
- Mechanical behavior: stiff and strong (comparable to those of the metals). Typically very hard.
- Historically, ceramics have exhibited extreme brittleness (lack of ductility) and are highly susceptible to fracture. However, newer ceramics are being engineered to have improved resistance to fracture; these materials are used for cookware, cutlery, and even automobile engine parts.
- Insulative to the passage of heat and electricity
- Very resistant to hard environments compared to metals and polymers.
- They may be transparent, translucent or opaque.
- Some may exhibit magnetic behavior.

### Polymers

- Plastic and rubber materials
- Many of them are organic compounds that are chemically based on carbon, hydrogen, and other nonmetallic elements (i.e., O, N, and Si)
- Large molecular structures, often chainlike in nature, that often have a backbone of carbon atoms
- Low densities.
- Mechanical properties: on the basis of their low densities, many times their stiffnesses and strengths on a per-mass basis are comparable to those of the metals and ceramics.
- Inert and unreactive in a large number of environments.
- Low electrical conductivities and are nonmagnetic.

### Composites

- Is composed of two (or more) individual materials that come from the other categories —metals, ceramics, and polymers.
- The design goal of a composite is to achieve a combination of properties that is not displayed by any single material and also to incorporate the best characteristics of each of the component materials.
- Some categories:
    - **Elastomers** — polymeric materials that display rubbery-like behavior (high degrees of elastic deformation).
    - **Natural materials** — those that occur in nature; for example, wood, leather, and cork.
    - **Foams** — typically polymeric materials that have high porosities (contain a large volume fraction of small pores), which are often used for cushions and packaging.

### Advanced materials

Materials utilized in high-technology (or high-tech) applications

- **Semiconductors** have electrical properties that are intermediate between those of electrical conductors (i.e., metals and metal alloys) and insulators (i.e., ceramics and polymers)
- **Biomaterials** must be biocompatible—compatible with body tissues and fluids with which they are in contact over acceptable time periods. Suitable biomaterials are to be found among the several classes of materials discussed earlier in this chapter—i.e., metal alloys, ceramics, polymers, and composite materials.
- **Smart (or intelligent) materials** are able to sense changes in their environment and then respond to these changes in predetermined manners—traits that are also found in living organisms. In addition, this smart concept is being extended to rather sophisticated systems that consist of both smart and traditional materials. Components of a smart material (or system) include some type of  (which detects an input signal) and an  (which performs a responsive and adaptive function).

    sensor

    actuator

- **Nanomaterials**, which may be any one of the four basic types. The nano prefix denotes that the dimensions of these structural entities are on the order of a nanometer —as a rule, less than 100 nanometers (nm; equivalent to the diameter of approximately 500 atoms)

## Top- down and Bottom- up Science

Prior to the advent of nanomaterials, the general procedure scientists used to understand the chemistry and physics of materials was to begin by studying large and complex structures and then investigate the fundamental building blocks of these structures that are smaller and simpler. This approach is sometimes termed **top-down science.**

However, with the development of scanning probe microscopes, which permit observation of individual atoms and molecules, it has become possible to design and build new structures from their atomic-level constituents, one atom or molecule at a time (i.e., “materials by design”). This ability to arrange atoms carefully provides opportunities to develop mechanical, electrical, magnetic, and other properties that are not otherwise possible. We call this the **bottom-up approach**, and the study of the properties of these materials is termed nanotechnology.
