> *In the past months I went from being the happy state of singletown to the happy silly state of ‘Hey! This is my boyfriend. Have I told you he is the most amazing person in the world (yes, probably like a thousand times)* 

> *Being in love is like that – silly, inexplicable*

> *It simply just happens*

> *Sometimes we do look for it a little bit under some random rocks we encounter in our journey.*

> *I treasure being in love because it brings the best out of you. Is not that is not you when you are on love, but it’s a better version of you.*

> - Playa del Carmen. November 6th, 2017

Over two years have passed since I wrote that small statement, and I’m happy to find myself in the same silly and unexplained state with the same person.

Who even in this craziness still manages to get the best out of me *almost* everyday.
