> Philavery = an idiosyncratic collection of uncommon and pleasing words.

I encountered Foyle’s Philavery, a little flowered covered book with red spines, while I was working at a bookshop a couple of years ago. The term stick with me so much that I used it as the tittle of my lists of new words in every journal since then. Here’s a small recollection of my last added words:

* Memories = looking at the present trace of the past
* Harangues = lengthy and aggressive speech
* Elation = great hapiness
* Volitional = the faculty or power of using one’s will
* Epiphenomenon = a secondary effect or byproduct that arises from but does not causally influence a process in particular – (Ted’s)
