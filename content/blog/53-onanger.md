#### *For my granddad. Happy 86th Birthday*

A couple of valuable lessons became evident after my grandma bashed to me over the phone the other day:

* #1. Her anger and mistreatment reflect nothing about me but everything about her. And more importantly, it is impersonal.

* #2. Non-engagement in violent speech is the best tool to dismembering the anger you are receiving from the other side. When two people are acting mean to each other it’s a fight but, when only one of the parties is involved it’s just a crazy person yelling over a phone.

* #3. Compassion can be found in these moments and the way I discovered was by realizing that her anger affected both of us but in different ways. And while I’m still able to retreat into Ted’s arms or Frankie’s canine tenderness for comfort, she made it a life-long mission to push everyone away. Even if these places of solace were readily available, she wouldn’t know how to ask for it.
