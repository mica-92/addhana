![My Mexican Closet](/3-123.jpg)

It was a beautiful late summer afternoon, we were sitting on the porch, drinking mate drinking in Harrisonburg, the day we decided to live with less stuff. “We should be able to name everything we own” and so we settle on the quest to own 123 things. And although we don’t really keep track of the amount of things do think we been living with less things we normally did and made smarter shopping decisions when we had to make a 2-month apartment into a home.

Minimalism is a movement were you (try) to posses only things that add value to your life or help you fulfill a specific need. It is a way to unclutter your mind and living environment of unnecessary things to make space to what truly matters, which are usually not material things.

Living under this philosophy while travelling, where I’m trying to be more conscious of what I buy and posses has made me realize how much junk I own, and how much money I spent on it too. How we buy things we don’t necessary need just for the sake of buying or under the pretext that we might need them some day.

My closet has been composed of 35 items (excluding underwear, obviously) for the past 2 months and I could have never been happier. I discover that, in a way, owning little frees you and that is something we don’t usually think about but objects work as anchors. They tied us to a place and to them. They might even let us think they are indispensable and unreplaceble, when all they are is that, things.
