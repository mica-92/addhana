<h2>#1 7 days.

<p class="quote">'Cause I knew you<br>
Steppin' on the last train<br>
Marked me like a bloodstain, I<br>
I knew you<br>
Tried to change the ending<br>
Peter losing Wendy, I<br>
I knew you<br>
Leavin' like a father<br>
Running like water, I<br>
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
