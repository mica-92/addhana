I’m a nerd.

There’s no news on the statement made above, I know it, you know it, we all know it, and fantasy books bring the most nerdy part of my personality. I read Harry Potter so many times in my life that I already lost count of them and the past couple of years my time has been divided between The Kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick Ruthfuss and, of course, the amazing A Song of Ice and Fire Series by GRR Martin (yes, I read the books before the series came out; no, I did not like the last season but every Sunday at 9pm I was religiously sat in front of the TV no matter what part of the world I was anyway). So when my sister told me a High Valyrian course was available in Duolingo, all I could do was jump to the website and start learning learning this conlang as if I could do something with it.

The only language I ever learned is English which I have been speaking it for so long now, I’m a self declared proficiency student (*cough* native), and a couple of frustrated attempts from my school teachers to teach me German and Italian. So when this idea popped into my head I decided to test a couple of things a long the way. The first one was to see if I could learn a language all by myself or at least to get to a pre- intermediate/ intermediate level; secondly see if I could discover the way my brain learns to develop a strategy to move to more serious languages and last but not least see if I could achieve this in 30 days. Part of me also wanted to see if I could manage to understand language, in a more grammatical and linguistic way, in order to be able to apply this knowledge to my new career as an English teacher. For all I could tell it was a win- win everywhere.

So that’s how I set my mind the first day of my Duolingo course, moving my self through (nominative) nouns and basic adjectives. I thought this is easy, it’s just vocabulary learning and a couple of verb tenses and I’m done. Advancing through the course the ‘accusative case’ was introduced and I’m like.. mmm okay this still seems to be normal; soon discover that adjectives also change their ending in order to modify the that accusative noun. Keep moving and discovered there are 4 different genders for a noun with 6 different noun declensions and 8 different cases for the nouns, that the adjectives, 3 different types of these, are affected by this noun setting all the time, changing their endings according to this cases, the gender and if it’s plural or singular (new categories where added to like paucal and collective), and that there are words called adverbs. Needless to say that my anki-flashcard, that I was managing so good to keep up to date, become obsolete on a daily basis considering the amount of information I was learning as I moved through the course, so I just stop making them and see how far could this go; because for all I could tell Duolingo was not being a 100% honest in each step of the way as always new things seemed to be appearing of lesson I had already practiced. This was becoming so complex that I thought of just moving to Latin which seems to have a similar grammatical setting with declensions and such (and kinda of still thinking about this one).

Under this prospect a regular person would just go ‘F*@k it’ and close the laptop and head to McDonald’s to buy a quarter- pound- burger; but for me it was this was eye opening situations. I got so compelled with the small things languages have, that I soon discovered myself looking for proper definitions of the part of speech, like verbs, adverbs, adjectives, pronoun, direct object, among other. The thing is that we when we usually enroll on a language course we don’t really LEARN a language, we just do to learn the basic to achieve an efficient communication; but not all this ‘hard grammar’ tips and tricks all languages have to offer.

Anyway, as the natural enthusiast I am, now I’m more excited to learn Valyrian than ever before, and I’ll let you know how that went.
