As part of my (many) quarantine challenges, I started playing Scrabble last week.

Iâ€™m not a natural. English is not my motherâ€™s tongue and although Iâ€™ve always read a lot it was not until I had to sit for the GRE, and encountered the monstrous Verbal Section, that I made a conscious effort to expand my vocabulary.

The bright side of this whole endeavor is that thereâ€™s lots of room for improvement ðŸ™‚

Yesterday for the first time since I started I came upon my first Bingo word (meaning I used all 7 tiles on my rack) and a total of 86 points.

It was a very joyful moment!
