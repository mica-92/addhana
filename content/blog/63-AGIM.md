It is hard finding someone that does not recommend ‘A Gentleman in Moscow‘, from my mother-in-law to my boyfriend and <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/A-Gentleman-in-Moscow">Bill Gates</a>, Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov seems to have earned a place in everyone’s heart. And I proved to be no exception. I loved this book and part of the appeal lingers in the fact that it reminded me of one of my longtime favorites <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3328617-la-sombra-del-viento">‘The Shadow of the Wind’</a> by Carlos Ruiz Safón. A nice pastiche of fiction and historical events full of valuable life lessons particularly poignant in this Covid19- times.
