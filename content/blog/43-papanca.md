> *Papañca is the Pali term used to describe the tendency of the mind to spread out from and elaborate upon any sense object that arises in experience, smothering it with wave after wave of mental elaboration, most of which is illusory, repetitive, and even obsessive, which effectively blocks any sort of mental calm or clarity of mind.*
