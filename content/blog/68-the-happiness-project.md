Quarantine has been a rediscovery of Dan Harris and his 10% happier project. I’ve attended all his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb3AWCFuxotrXmgqUHQdwyg">live meditations</a> (while they were running), enrolled in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.changecollective.tenpercenthappier&hl=en_US">TPH app</a>, and I’ve been listening to his <a href="https://www.tenpercent.com/podcast">podcast</a> almost daily. His book <a href="https://wikipedia.com">(10% happier)</a> was the first audiobook I listened to in the theme of meditation and Buddhism. I was living in Mexico, just recently started dating Ted and I was open to trying new ways to improve my life. Ted was all into meditation, he had had recently completed his first 7-day retreat in IMS that July.

In his podcast, Dan interviews different meditation teachers, health professionals, and cool people in general that are either meditator themselves or have a genuine interest in self-discovery and life improvement. One of them was <a href="https://gretchenrubin.com/">Gretchen Rubin</a>. Not only she was the (intended) first guest if the show, but she has participated at least 3 more times since then. With her self-professed tag of a happiness bully and her jovial voice, I couldn’t stop myself from getting her books and started listening to her podcast. The book I’m working on right now is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6398634-the-happiness-project">The Happiness Project</a>. The narrates her search for better habits and happier morning by dividing them into different categories and focusing on a specific subject each month (for example, January – Vitality). 

Considering all the books, MOOCs, and crazy new habits I’ve undertaken during the quarantine, I guessed it would be fun to create my version of the happiness project. My project will have fewer categories and I’ll focus 2 weeks on each subject to select the habits that work best for me and it will be a great way to merge it with my Peloton challenge. 

So for the next couple of days, I’ll be posting the different categories with the habits and books I’m planning on reading about each subject. Following Gretchen’s scheme to I’ll create my own set of <a href="https://addhana.com/blog/69-rules/">**Lessons learned in (Young)-adulthood**</a>, lessons I’d learned with some difficulty in this 27 years of existence.

All blog-posts will be under the Happiness Project tag.

<h4>So, let’s get happier!</h4>
