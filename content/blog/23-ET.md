November 4th was my dad’s birthday so I called home to be present being far away. Truth is while I’m traveling I hardly ever call home, I don’t like it, too much me- focus, but I try to make exceptions during special occasion like this one. Half my family is at the country house, the other is getting there the next day for the big asado.

I haven’t even send him a text message as we were on our technology- free day off, out all day in Tulum; so I decided to do a ‘surprise’ WhatsApp video call.

Pruuum, Pruuum (onomatopoeia of the WA ringing thing).

Mum appears on the screen ‘Hi baby, how are you doing?’

‘Great mum thank you, how about you?’

‘Good, excelent making everything ready, the neighborhood’s are stopping by (… Random chatter for 3 seconds)’

My grandma shows up ‘Where’s Ted?’

‘I had him for dinner last night haha’

‘I don’t see him. Where is he?’

‘On the other side of the room, sitting on the couch doing some things on the computer’

‘Tell him that I’m not seeing him. That he needs to take care of you and that you are the best’

‘(me a little uncomfortable) eee sure, he is listening to it all anyway. No problem. Tell Dad to come to the phone’

Mum screaming on the background ‘have you told him we are all a little crazy?’

‘I think he figured that out already’

Bottom line of the story, I lost my rockstar status, Ted took it away from me.
