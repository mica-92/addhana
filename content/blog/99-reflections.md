Sometimes in the midst of our daily routine, we simply forget to breathe.

To breathe and look around us. To realize that we are exactly where we want to be. That all the work we are putting in will eventually pay off, the same way it paid off in the past, which got us to the place we are right now - drinking mate, thousand miles away from home, and going through my favorite season for the second time this year.

It's fall again, and the trees are slowly catching up. 2020 was crazy.
