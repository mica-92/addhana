The organization of my digital life just took a new level, I just started organizing my Google Photos website. I was always a little obsessed with photographs and not wanting to lose them so, it hurts to know all those pictures I lost from my teen years when cellphones and digital cameras just started, backups where a tedious thing and only god knows where those pictures are but I have a decent collection starting 2009 and from my early childhood (thanks mum).

While doing this it became impossible not to teletransport to the past. My first (and only) trip to Disney, vacations in Brasil, friends that I no longer speak anymore, family that is no longer with us, relationships that did not work. Itâ€™s funny to realize that all this snapshots and the anecdotes that go with them only linger in our memory and no where else.
