# Lecture - 2 Defects and Elasticity

"Materials are like people is their defects what makes them interesting" 

## Point defects

If you put a defect into the crystal it will deform the lattice and it will be associated with strain energy.

![Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled.png](/Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled.png)

Happen in one specific locations. Different types:

- Intertisial solute - not of the same type pf atoms and is not in the location where its supposed to be
- Self-interstitial - right kind but not in an appropriate lattice point
- Vacancy - missing atom.
- Substitutional Solute - right place in the lattice but wrong type of atom.

## Mechanical Properties of Crystal

Crystals can be model in different ways. Atoms stretch in figure 2 because of the applied forces, similar to a macroscopic spring. With reasonably small loads we can return to its original configuration, a truly elastic response does not change the microstructure when I change the forces back to the initial position. There is no hysteresis. It can be elastic but not linear (green line)

![Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%201.png](/Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%201.png)

Plasticity involves permanent changes in the microstructure. In this case, shearing of the planes. When the unloading occurs, the elastic strain is restored to zero, but the δplastic remains. So when we analyze the graph at the bottom, initially linear elastic region, then Yield, red linethe slope of the curve diminishes but  a flattening force that goes to a larger and when you unload the same slope as the elastic curve, hysteresis is created, atominc bonding the linear elastic.

Macroscopic sprng, associated with Hooke's Law. Elasticity in materials is similar in idea but its in 3D needs a tensor form. Linear elastic deformation that is fully  reversable

![Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%203.png](/Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%203.png)

## Stress

Force and displacement we can measure. nit ideal because they depend they do not tell you about the material distorsion because it is not related to the material dimensions. 

Stress - the force normalized byt the cross-section area of the material. 

![Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%204.png](/Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%204.png)

The same force in both samples. But because 1 is narrower that material will deform more.

Force is an extensive quantity becauase it does not depend on the material properties. While Stress is intensive because it is normalized where the A is perpendicular to the area Stress (σ) = F/A.

**Engineering Stress** = F/A₀ initial cross-section before the force is applied works well with low deformations.

**True Stress** = F/Ai where Ai is the instantaneous cross-sectional area in a specific moment

[ ] = N/m2 = J/m3 = Pascal = Pa

## Strain

![Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%205.png](/Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%205.png)

Intrinsic displacement we define strain is dimensionless εᵧᵧ = ΔL/L. Again there are different types of  strain like Engineering or True (similar to the stress definition)

## Stress Tensor

# Isotropic Materials

![Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%2013.png](/Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%2013.png)

# Anisotropic Materials

![Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%2014.png](/Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%2014.png)

6 x 6 because we have 3 for the shear strss and 3 for the normal 

![Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%2015.png](/Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%2015.png)

The maximum number is 21 independent elastic constant and this is the case for the triclinic system.

## Symmetries applications to Crystal Systems

# Lecture 3 - Defects and Elasticity

Just like with Hooke's Law we also can relate the 3D equivalent of force and displacement and we had this elastic ocnstant tensor that related the shear and normal strains with shear and normal stresses. the more isotropic the more symmetrical the less constants we need.  with the maximum number being 21

![Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%2018.png](/Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%2018.png)

# Strain Energy

![Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%2019.png](/Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%2019.png)

C and strain in the end what we have two separate tems lambda is lame cosntant G shear modulus and the sum of the normal strains (εᵧᵧ) sqaured plus a second with the shear. 

![Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%2020.png](/Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%2020.png)

At small strains we assume that all materials are linear elastic  and for an ideal linear elastic material we have some linear increase with strain with stress. POint 2 slope decrease, important quatity onset permanent microstructrual change, where you define it? is a challenge. area underneath the curve strain energy related to the elastic deformation (streatching of the bonds in the structure)  and then there is a plastic ocmponent (rearranging the bons) energy lost to the flow of the macroscturcture. Different crystal unit cell interstitial sites, opportunities for defects in ways that minimize the energy strain

![Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%2021.png](/Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%2021.png)

Fe- C

With only iron we move from BCC to FCC to BCC again. different solubilities limit, BCC phases very low (all the C you can fit to the crystal before it will crush into a different phase, but for the austenite you have higher solubility. the reason is the FCC for Fe happens to be with the space between the atoms (see diagram) there is a strong energy penalty in the BCC, and therefore it is *cheaper* to create a new phase than try to get impurities in the existing one. 

![Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%2022.png](/Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%2022.png)

To mantain neutrality we need to miss a cation and an anion Scottky. Moving the cation to another palce is Frnakel. Alloying 

![Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%2023.png](/Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%2023.png)

If point defects increase the energy of a system, why do they form? The answer is **entropy. Point defects are equilibrium defects, the disorder is expected to be there even at equilibrium ( no due to a process over time). Change in the whole free neergy is assoicated with Svib because the spot where the vacancy is has a different vibration. RT ln nv configurations entropy what we obtain for mixing A and B together, favors mixing.** 

**nv concentration of vacacies. Same approach for instertisial sites.** 

![Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%2024.png](/Module%208%201e0a60a7ce364b218e1bb09e2fd13ba2/Untitled%2024.png)

the second equation is sqaured because there are two n (a cation and an ion.

Ep the nergy removing an ion.

How do we know this is real? iland bigger as atoms are being moved up in the crystal and as temperature increases.
