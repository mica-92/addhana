Another month, another chapter in the Happiness Project and, August is going to be all about **Social Connections**. 

In less than 10 days we'll be moving to the Northern Hemisphere. And although I'm excited about this new life- chapter, I want to stop daydreaming and actually make the most out of these next couple of days. 

The quarantine is still pretty strict here in Buenos Aires and that posses some issues with seeing my friends, as some are more comfortable than others violating the general advice of "stay at home and see no one". But that shouldn't be a deterrent factor in trying to connect with them in a meaningful way. In the last zoom reunions and street-coffee gathering I've come to the realization, I'm too self-absorbed. I tend to make every single thing said by the other person as an opportunity to mention 1) a personal anecdote or 2) an unwanted piece of advice. Becoming a better listener is going to be a top priority for this month. 

Also, I want to enjoy my family as much as possible. Spend quality time with them and have a small birthday gathering. I'll miss everyone so much. In the last couple of quarantine family meetings, I got a wind of what a great family I have and how much we care for one another. I am harsh with them much too often, criticizing and giving (once again) my unwanted and sometimes unproductive opinion. In this regard, there are several attitudes I'll like to work on: Firstly, learning to accept people as they are even in their b#$@t; the <a href="https://tedslocum.com/daily/2020/07/19/Coming-to-America">Marian-USA</a> thingy goes in this category. Secondly, before talking questioning is *<a href="https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/samphappalapa">samphappalapa</a>* or what I am about to say leads to a fruitful conversation. Lastly, checking my intentions, *why am I saying this?*. Or how the Dalai Lama emphasizes this teaching in his <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38210.The_Art_of_Happiness">book</a> (one of my current reads) with the question: *is it conducive to my own or other people's Happiness?*. 

The upcoming months will be ones of social turnabouts: new city, new school, new acquaintances, new friends, new social milieus. Working on these attitudes will also help me in this arena. 

## Main points

* Family.
Spend time with family either virtually or in-person. This includes my extended family. Try to make a bigger effort in socializing with Ted's family.

* Friends.
Spend time with friends, when unable to see them in-person make time for a video call or messages. Get more involved.

* Social Media. 
I have a love-hate relationship with social media. But what happened after my <a href="https://addhana.com/blog/65-reconnecting/">graduation</a> left me thinking that there might be a way of creating a healthy relationship with it and use it no so much as a social comparison tool but as a way to keep in touch with people. We'll see.

* Attitude. 
Work on important verbal communication milestones: listening, intention, and acceptance. 

## Books

I had various books planned for a **Communication** month but considering all the traveling and moving around I doubt I'll be able to do much reading. So instead I'll concentrate my reading list on learning about Philly, <a href="https://tedslocum.com/assets/images/frank-mat.jpg">Benjamin Franklin</a>, 16th and 17th Century American History, UPenn History and, Ice Mechanics.
