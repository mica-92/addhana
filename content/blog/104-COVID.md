Despite all the uncertainty surrounding COVID, we have sufficient evidence to show that death rates among young adults are pretty low. It is possibly even lower if the individual has no pre-existing conditions (like asthma or some auto-immune disease). But even with a death-rate of 0.1% is 500% more than the one we observe in the regular flu-season (0.02%).

I know I am on the *good* side of statistics. If, by any chance, I get COVID, there's a big chance I end up having only mild symptoms and no severe, long-lasting effects. But the reason why I am resisting to engage in social activities and why I doubt attending COVID-weddings is because I feel a strong sense of moral responsibility towards everybody else. 

The moment I get the disease, I become a vector of spreading. And even with the mask on, as I remain asymptomatic, I can go days getting other people contaminated. And I do not know anything about these other people, what if they take care of an elderly person or have a new-born in their household? What happens if one of these people becomes one more number in the statistic?

I rustle with these thoughts every day. And I've been for the last eight months. What is the "rightest" thing to do? Where is the limit of our responsibility with one another as a society? Shouldn't we, the ones on the *good* side of the statistics, be doing everything in our power to minimize the spread? Or should we keep on moving and working on "trying to achieve" the heard-immunity? How many lives are too many to achieve that? 

I ended up attending last Saturday's graduate potluck after avoiding social gatherings for a month and a half.
