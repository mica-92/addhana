      <description>In another chapter of Mica-Designs, a fellow graduate student ask me to help her design a logo for raising funds for a Hurricane Relief Fund for Central America.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on and off with these ones for the past couple of weeks, not really knowing what Nati wanted or finding sources of inspiration on Google. These are the ones I ended up picking for her :)

      <description>As I observe Franklin every day, I wonder how something with such a strong character -with defined tastes and ways of communicating what he wants- not to be conscious?
For me, Frankie presents all the attributes by which I believe there&amp;rsquo;s a Mica. I have a distinct personality, erratic and highly emotional, and ways of expressing to the world who and how I am. And Franklin does too. His toolbox is different than mine.</description>

      <title>A Bucket Full of Flowers: Philly Edition</title>
      <link>https://addhana.com/blog/106-abucketfullofflowers/</link>

      <description>A couple of years ago, I wrote, what remains to this day, one of my favorite blog posts of all time, A Bucket Full of Fowers.
A hundred blogs and three years later, flowers remain a small tradition in our apartments. They were for the remainder of our life in Mexico; it continued while in Argentina, and now we pay patronage here in Philly. Flowers still bring me as much joy as ever, and I take care of them with the same devotion, changing their water every day, getting rid of unnecessary leaves, and throwing away the ones starting to wither.</description>

      <title>The Second Kind of Impossible</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I had learned early on to pay close attention whenever an idea is dismissed as ‚Äúimpossible.‚Äù Most of the time, scientists are referring to something that is truly out of the question, like violating the conservation of energy or creating a perpetual motion machine. It never makes sense to pursue those kinds of ideas. But sometimes, an idea is judged to be ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù based on assumptions that could be violated under certain circumstances that have never been considered before.</description>

      <title>Being on the good side of statistics</title>

      <description>Despite all the uncertainty surrounding COVID, we have sufficient evidence to show that death rates among young adults are pretty low. It is possibly even lower if the individual has no pre-existing conditions (like asthma or some auto-immune disease). But even with a death-rate of 0.1% is 500% more than the one we observe in the regular flu-season (0.02%).
I know I am on the good side of statistics. If, by any chance, I get COVID, there&amp;rsquo;s a big chance I end up having only mild symptoms and no severe, long-lasting effects.</description>

&#34;Hey I just met you.And this is crazy.
But here&#39;s my number
Committee, maybe?&#34;
But the good news even with all that ackwardness 3 out of 5 have already accepted. One if from New Zealand :)

      <description>Sometimes in the midst of our daily routine, we simply forget to breathe.
To breathe and look around us. To realize that we are exactly where we want to be. That all the work we are putting in will eventually pay off, the same way it paid off in the past, which got us to the place we are right now - drinking mate, thousand miles away from home, and going through my favorite season for the second time this year.</description>

      <description>This week has all been about moving to Philly and getting ready for the fall semester. As part of my graduate education, I have to TA for at least two semesters. I am thrilled about this new role. Teaching has always been something I wanted to give it a try, something that I could see my self doing as a career path along with being part of a research team. Before throwing us to the wolves, the school offered a two week TA training, and opposite to my expectations, I found the seminars very insightful.</description>

      <description>And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
I&amp;rsquo;m still on that tightrope
I&amp;rsquo;m still trying everything to get you laughing at me
And I&amp;rsquo;m still a believer, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know why
I&amp;rsquo;ve never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
I&amp;rsquo;m still on that trapeze
I&amp;rsquo;m still trying everything to keep you looking at me</description>

      <description>My typing skills are horrible, and for quite a few months Ted has been emphasizing the importance of developing this skill.
A healthy bet has emerged between Ted and I. I need to get to an average of 50 wpm faster than him to 100 wpm typing.
My initial average 26.2 wpm (07/28). Current average 34.3 wpm (08/06)

      <description>Another month, another chapter in the Happiness Project and, August is going to be all about Social Connections.
In less than 10 days we&amp;rsquo;ll be moving to the Northern Hemisphere. And although I&amp;rsquo;m excited about this new life- chapter, I want to stop daydreaming and actually make the most out of these next couple of days.
The quarantine is still pretty strict here in Buenos Aires and that posses some issues with seeing my friends, as some are more comfortable than others violating the general advice of &amp;ldquo;stay at home and see no one&amp;rdquo;.</description>

I must admit I did not enjoy it as much as I thought I was going to. Going through every room and deciding what to take, what to give, and what to throw was a great source of anxiety.</description>

      <description>Growing up, the way my parent&amp;rsquo;s house looked was always a source of stress for me. I was never comfortable. Bringing friends was an avoid-at-all-cost-task. Nothing ever seemed to have a place and stuff just pilled everywhere. Although I won&amp;rsquo;t get into too much detail, I now can understand how that happened (but I do struggle to see how it can still be going on).
So, as soon as I moved with Ted I wanted to avoid all the mistakes I felt my parent&amp;rsquo;s made in their own space.</description>

      <description>For the last year or so I&amp;rsquo;ve been witnessing the unfolding of the United States&amp;rsquo; presidential election. NYT articles, debates, Friday&amp;rsquo;s Shields and Brooks analysis on PBS, Bill Maher, Sam Harris, you name it I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to it all. From the, at one point, 25 nominees of the Democratic Party only Biden is standing.
Ted is very happy about this fact. Although it would have never been his (or probably anybody&amp;rsquo;s) first choice, he seriously believes Biden is the one that will defeat Trump in November.</description>

      <title>The Art of Discarding - Book</title>

      <description>Like everyone else, I heard about this book after reading Marie Kondo&amp;rsquo;s The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. We are about to move pretty soon and I need motivation and willingness to let things go. This book provided a lot of motivation for discarding, at times even a little bit too much.
Nagisa clearly states our underlying motivations for not getting rid of our possessions and how sooner or later stuff just ends up overflowing not only physical space but our mental space as well.</description>

      <description>I was planning on doing an entire month for my vitality category, but I changed my mind. These are the chief pillars for a healthy life and I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to implement them throughout the quarantine with varying degrees of success depending on the week.
In order not to get too overwhelmed I will add these important having in pairs every week. I have a small headstart, as my yoga practice is well established already (Ashtanga Primary Series 5 times a week) and, I&amp;rsquo;ve been meditating on and off.</description>

      <description>Often learn more from one person‚Äôs highly idiosyncratic experiences than I do from sources that detail universal principles or cite up-to-date studies. I find greater value in what specific individuals tell me worked for them than in any other kind of argument‚Äîand that‚Äôs true even when we seem to have nothing in common.
Gretchen Rubin&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Happiness Project&amp;rdquo; is exactly what the title anticipates: a recollection of her journey through finding a greater sense of joy and happiness through small habit changes.</description>

      <description>Moving is an imminent fact, and therefore the &amp;ldquo;home &amp;amp; clutter&amp;rdquo; category seemed a great place to start my happiness project. Moving is not a minor activity, research cites it as the most stressful life event. Nonetheless, we run with an advantage. As we are moving to a completely different country, time zone, and hemisphere, we trully need to declutter and take only the essentials.
Apart from the physical objects, taking care of the emotional aspect is also tectonic because we won&amp;rsquo;t be living in Argentina for the next 4 years.</description>

      <description>You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.
  Habits compound, meaning what you do every day matters more than what you do once in a while.
  Never miss the same event/habit twice.
  Don‚Äôt judge easily, you never know what the other person is going through.
  Everything comes with time, so take the time and enjoy the journey.</description>

      <description>Quarantine has been a rediscovery of Dan Harris and his 10% happier project. I‚Äôve attended all his live meditations (while they were running), enrolled in the TPH app, and I‚Äôve been listening to his podcast almost daily. His book (10% happier) was the first audiobook I listened to in the theme of meditation and Buddhism. I was living in Mexico, just recently started dating Ted and I was open to trying new ways to improve my life.</description>

      <description>Like every Tuesday morning, yesterday I woke up early, kiss Frankie, and after an hour of journaling, I went grocery shopping.
But, unlike every other Tuesday, Blanca‚Äôs vegetable store was closed.
This minor setback disrupted my entire shopping experience. I was so upset. In my head, all there was were thoughts about how dare they close without letting me know and how I should probably start looking for a new vegetable place.</description>

With the COVID situation and the unsafeness associated with close contact activities, we decided the first purchase to be a peloton bike. But in order to make things a little bit more fun, we decided to add a small challenge.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I (finally) graduated from college. After years of hard work with countless hours with my butt in the chair and my nose between textbooks, I made it over 5 years of intense work, all summarized in a 40-minute presentation.
Many of my close friends gathered to see the whole thing unfold in youtube, and reading their comments and feeling their virtual presence had a nice comforting sensation in a time where the sense of isolation is the new norm.</description>

I‚Äôm not a natural. English is not my mother‚Äôs tongue and although I‚Äôve always read a lot it was not until I had to sit for the GRE, and encountered the monstrous Verbal Section, that I made a conscious effort to expand my vocabulary.

      <description>I recently finished the Success course offered by Wharton and all I can say are positive things about it. This course was great. The content in itself might not be mind-blowing (at the end of the day we all know that there‚Äôs an inner and outer sphere of success), but the exercises provided by Richard Shell, the instructor were poignant. They kept me thinking in these topics even after the lecture was done, and sparked pages of introspection in my morning journal.</description>

      <description>For someone whose first thought in the morning is setting the intention for a mindful day (however that wants to manifest itself that day) I found it fascinating how my mind has been residing in imagination this past couple of weeks. My last post is living proof of that. This quarantine, and the incapacity for action I feel due to the confinement has got me into self-centered loops of thoughts with a pretty obvious theme: wanting.</description>

      <description>For my granddad. Happy 86th Birthday A couple of valuable lessons became evident after my grandma bashed to me over the phone the other day:
  #1. Her anger and mistreatment reflect nothing about me but everything about her. And more importantly, it is impersonal.
  #2. Non-engagement in violent speech is the best tool to dismembering the anger you are receiving from the other side. When two people are acting mean to each other it‚Äôs a fight but, when only one of the parties is involved it‚Äôs just a crazy person yelling over a phone.</description>

I enjoyed the course so much, that I enrolled in the UPenn Foundations of Positive Psychology Specialization and already audited Part I. It is a long course lasting a total of 10 weeks, I manage to complete it in 5 weeks by bingeing the first week through all the lectures and leaving the last 4 weeks for the Final Reweirement Challenge.</description>

      <description>Papa√±ca is the Pali term used to describe the tendency of the mind to spread out from and elaborate upon any sense object that arises in experience, smothering it with wave after wave of mental elaboration, most of which is illusory, repetitive, and even obsessive, which effectively blocks any sort of mental calm or clarity of mind.

      <description>I‚Äôm back! After a month almost of no updates, I decided (my followers, Ted, asked for it) to come back to blogging. Being in Argentina, these past weeks have been crazy with family meeting, friends to see, coffee shops to explore, studying to do, old photo albums to flip through, books to read, pinky foot toe to heal, habits to break. It also included my very first Thanksgiving celebration.
Holidays + Mexico Round 2 are coming soon and I could be more excited about what the future has to hold.</description>

      <description>Since Ted told me he was coming to Buenos Aires I made a list of my favorite spots in my neighborhood, La Lucila. Almost a week into our Buenos Aires adventure (or how we call it, Chapter 6) this is how out list is going
Best fabrica de pasta ‚Äì La Imperial. Glorious ravioli and fetuccini we (Ted) cooked to my family
Best medialunas ‚Äì La de Vicente L√≥pez. Service was okay, but oh my God those buttered medialunas are always the best</description>

      <description>The organization of my digital life just took a new level, I just started organizing my Google Photos website. I was always a little obsessed with photographs and not wanting to lose them so, it hurts to know all those pictures I lost from my teen years when cellphones and digital cameras just started, backups where a tedious thing and only god knows where those pictures are but I have a decent collection starting 2009 and from my early childhood (thanks mum).</description>

      <description>Time in Playa del Carmen is coming to an end. The next 10 days are fully occupied with traveling and DIY meditation retreats, so we decided take a day off and give one last visit technology-free visit of the year to our place in the world (La Zebra) .
My inner goal was to try to stay mindful all day (or at least most of it). So here are some mental highlights of the day:</description>

      <description>November 4th was my dad‚Äôs birthday so I called home to be present being far away. Truth is while I‚Äôm traveling I hardly ever call home, I don‚Äôt like it, too much me- focus, but I try to make exceptions during special occasion like this one. Half my family is at the country house, the other is getting there the next day for the big asado.
I haven‚Äôt even send him a text message as we were on our technology- free day off, out all day in Tulum; so I decided to do a ‚Äòsurprise‚Äô WhatsApp video call.</description>

 I encountered Foyle‚Äôs Philavery, a little flowered covered book with red spines, while I was working at a bookshop a couple of years ago.

After a week in which I experienced every flavor of thought available to mankind (anxiousness, sadness, hopelessness, happiness and anxiety again), I found the best way for coping with this fluctuating state of mind‚Ä¶ simply re- read your favorite children‚Äôs book. The simplicity of it all gives you a great perspective of life.</description>

      <description>Holidays like D√≠a de los muertos (Halloween) make me feel an outsider of my own species.
Is not that I don‚Äôt like going out, but I just don‚Äôt feel such a strong feeling to connect with the masses in these kind of commercial holidays, probably just using them as an excuse to either eat a bunch of sugar in the form of hard candy or get dressed in an unusual, weird ‚Äòlikely to be regretted a couple of years from now‚Äô way, and get drunk.</description>

      <description>Life is a huge decision making process, everything revolving our lives was a decision taken at some point.
A big question is, what degree of freedom we have in our decisions? A few days ago this question was posted on our coffee break, and some people smarter than me stated there is no such thing as freewill, and that in this sense our brain does not really evaluate options, but the decision is already made.</description>

The memory of the first time I thought ‚ÄòThere might be something here‚Äô is still crystal clear in my mind. It was an afternoon, after our half- failed Appalachian hiking, we both were reading minding our own business but being there for each other. I was with my Kindle with ‚ÄòEating animals‚Äò, he was with his hardcover of ‚ÄòWhy Buddhism is True‚Äò. I was laying on the couch, he was sitting on the floor.</description>

When I was journaling, I wanted to study High Valyrian
When I was learning High Valyrian, I wanted to be at the 9am yoga class
When I decided I was not going to yoga in the morning but rather leave it for the afternoon, I wanted a coffee</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm a nerd.
There‚Äôs no news on the statement made above, I know it, you know it, we all know it, and fantasy books bring the most nerdy part of my personality. I read Harry Potter so many times in my life that I already lost count of them and the past couple of years my time has been divided between The Kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick Ruthfuss and, of course, the amazing A Song of Ice and Fire Series by GRR Martin (yes, I read the books before the series came out; no, I did not like the last season but every Sunday at 9pm I was religiously sat in front of the TV no matter what part of the world I was anyway).</description>

      <description>‚ÄòOn Sundays the office is closed‚Äô or so my boyfriend thought one of the first weekends we were at Playa del Carmen. I had woken up early to go to the market to buy groceries and such, when I saw a small stand were they were selling flowers; huge beautiful yellow, white, orange flowers. I thought flowers would make home a much cheerful place to work so I decided to buy flowers for my boyfriend.</description>

      <description>My first week of blogging is over and here are 7 highlights:
  According to people I write better than I talk (so imagine how I talk)
  It liberates your mind from random thoughts that keep appearing on a daily basis, it‚Äôs all about uncluttering
  Creating habits is easier when you are doing it with somebody else
  You can create a great unintended debate at dinnertime</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs amazing how the past lingers with us, even when we try to push it away. How things that we worked so much on, in many cases convincing ourselves that we had made peace with them, can find us in the most unthought places triggered by the most unusual things, like a phrase on a blog post.
I think this is true because we cannot really escape from those deterrent moments that made us who we are, no matter how much emotional- baggage they still carry with them; and that is due to those moments, that we are where we are right now.</description>

Wait! you never heard this before? Good, me neither and is because I just made this up. This is no psychological diagnose or anything of that sort is just the way I‚Äôve always been and that I think, right now, is the main reason of a great distress in my head.
I think I‚Äôm going through a quarter-of-a-century kinda crisis. I wake up every morning not knowing what I am going to do or where I‚Äôm heading.</description>

      <title>Job Hunt</title>

      <description>After a couple months in low- season Playa del Carmen I came to the realization that life is harder than it seems. I never considered myself lucky with my past jobs (always grateful, never lucky) but after a month of trying to get a decent paycheck in Mexico I started believing I was. Being a full time student of an (yet) unfinished major for most of my adult life, working was never a top priority for me, so my past jobs were jobs that I performed to have some kind of personal income or to pay for that year‚Äôs vacation.</description>

      <description>Every night when I go to bed I kiss my boyfriend goodnight, look at him in the eyes and tell him ‚ÄòI love you, baby‚Äô, After what follows complete silence.
It‚Äôs been a little bit less than 2 months since I made that first statement driving through Virginia the day I decided I was going to loose my flight ticket to explore the perks of living in Mexico with someone I met on a plane.</description>

      <description>It was a beautiful late summer afternoon, we were sitting on the porch, drinking mate drinking in Harrisonburg, the day we decided to live with less stuff. ‚ÄúWe should be able to name everything we own‚Äù and so we settle on the quest to own 123 things. And although we don‚Äôt really keep track of the amount of things do think we been living with less things we normally did and made smarter shopping decisions when we had to make a 2-month apartment into a home.</description>

      <title>Why am I doing this?</title>

      <description>Why am I writing a post a day? I think the best definition I could find was:
‚ÄúI want to write down my thoughts somewhere where I won‚Äôt be able to loose them or throw them away‚Äù
ecause that‚Äôs our tendency as Homo sapiens, to project certain perfection or vision of ourselves and see if we can deceive ourselves along the way too.
In that way when a writing is not what we expect, we discard it; when a feeling that is not ‚Äòpositive‚Äô or align with the ideal ‚Äòme‚Äô we tend to forget and pretend it was never there in the first place.</description>

      <description>‚ÄúWriting a novel is like driving a car at night. You can only see as far as your headlights go, but you can make the whole trip that way‚Äù
E. L. Doctorow ‚Äì Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott
And I kinda feel this is how my whole journey will go,
step by step, post by post
or as Anne‚Äôs father liked to say bird by bird
as I have never done anything like this before.</description>
