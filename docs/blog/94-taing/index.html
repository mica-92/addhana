<p>This week has all been about moving to Philly and getting ready for the fall semester. As part of my graduate education, I have to TA for at least two semesters. I am thrilled about this new role. Teaching has always been something I wanted to give it a try, something that I could see my self doing as a career path along with being part of a research team. Before throwing us to the wolves, the school offered a two week TA training, and opposite to my expectations, I found the seminars very insightful. An assorted number of topics were covered, from grading in the sciences to engaging students while working online, while using the same tools students will have to use throughout the semester (Canvas, Perusall and, Piazza). I also enjoyed the practical advice given by the group facilitators, who were fellow students with a whiff more of expertise in the classroom.</p>
<p>On Thursday morning, we had to present a 10-minute teaching demo. The topic was one of our choosing. The idea was to find new and creative ways for classroom engagement in this novel online-course era. I was looking forward to this activity. Geology is one of those peculiar sciences that offers fascinating topics without requiring a high level of expertise (although I must admit things do get much more interesting once you delve deeper into these questions). So, I wanted to make an impact, and therefore I chose volcanoes. I make the presentation, I prepare two different activities (including one with a video), I rehearse it a couple of times earlier that morning, and I choose to go third in line.</p>
<p>Everything was going well until my turn arrived. It was a disaster! My internet connection was surprisingly slow. Not only I was not able to play the video, but because of the technical difficulties, I ended up exceeding the time frame and not having the opportunity to present the final activity.  An absolute fail. Having said that, I truly believed I learned more about my broken performance than if it would have gone just the way I planned. And curiously enough the other day Ted and I were talking about the importance of failure in life, and how sometimes I believe I had it way too easy.</p>
<p>So cheers to me and my first failure at Penn. For many more to come in the next 4/5 years.

<p>By the way, I think this is my highest Grammarly Writing Score ever :)</p>
