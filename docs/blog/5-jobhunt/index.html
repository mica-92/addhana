<p><img src="/5-jobhunt.jpg" alt="Me at the necklace stand"></p>
<p>After a couple months in low- season Playa del Carmen I came to the realization that life is harder than it seems. I never considered myself lucky with my past jobs (always grateful, never lucky) but after a month of trying to get a decent paycheck in Mexico I started believing I was. Being a full time student of an (yet) unfinished major for most of my adult life, working was never a top priority for me, so my past jobs were jobs that I performed to have some kind of personal income or to pay for that year’s vacation. It soon stroke me that in what I been considering ‘transit jobs’ got me the some amount of money in 2 shifts that what I was making here in 2 weeks.</p>
<p>The job hunt for a job that covered my basic needs (rent, all other ‘normal’ expenses starting being extravagances and for food I got an agreement with my roommates) got me landing in two different jobs in a month span none of them satisfying my expectations. The first one included selling tequila under some sketchy sales ethics and the other one selling necklaces on different carts in 5th Avenue. I loved the latter more for a number reasons, which mainly include liking the sales tactics and the product, while looking good wearing them (just joking).</p>
<p>My performance is both jobs was very good considering the overall tourist situation getting me earnings that were equal or sometimes were higher than my coworkers that had been working longer than I did. I even got 3rd place on the sales rank after only 3 weeks on the necklace selling cart. But for some reason (the money + time equation was not summing up) none of them got me were I wanted, and so my job hunt continue.</p>
<p>After announcing my resignation in the necklace shop, one of the girls told me she was looking for an English course; after what I immediately responded ‘I’m an English teacher’. Lie! I never, ever, ever, gave an English lesson in my life (my only formal teaching training was helping my little brother with his school assignment), but having been learning English since I learned how to walk and having taken every single English test Cambridge decided to endorsed, I was up to the challenge.</p>
<p>Giving English lessons was something I always wanted to do but I never had the courage to. Having someone whose learning is depending on you is a BIG thing. It’s like being a parent, when a kid is doing something is not supposed to, we all know who to point our fingers to.</p>
<p>10 hours of teaching and countless reading about teaching strategies and presenting themes later, my student has been making some really good progress. I attribute this to the fact that she is highly dedicated to our English practice and that I enjoy it deeply. 2 hour conversation lessons with topics she enjoys boosted her confidence, in a lot of ways but specially at her workplace. It’s such a rewarding feeling when she comes class after class recalling all the English- speaking customers she had the last couple of days. The Canadian that needed a neon color 100 threads necklace or the Israeli guy that wanted the smallest size in different shades of green with a matching pair of earring, all with vocabulary I taught her in Lesson 2. Obviously, her pronunciation needs plenty of help, her grammar is not perfect either but seeing her loose her mental block and talk, its been on of the most heartwarming experiences I ever had.</p>
