<p>I’m a natural enthusiast.</p>
<p>Wait! you never heard this before? Good, me neither and is because I just made this up. This is no psychological diagnose or anything of that sort is just the way I’ve always been and that I think, right now, is the main reason of a great distress in my head.</p>
<p>I think I’m going through a quarter-of-a-century kinda crisis. I wake up every morning not knowing what I am going to do or where I’m heading. I drop- off school this past semester to experience something completely different of what I been doing the past four Octobers, but I realize that getting me out of my ‘comfort zone’ did not brought any answers to this existential questions just… more questions.</p>
<p>My biggest concern is not the lack of motivation to do things, is completely the opposite. Everything for me is a great source of motivation! Everything for me is interesting and think I can make something out of it. You name the topic I can find a good reason for doing it. I think I can learn something from every experience out there and make it worth living it. I’m one of those people that if you give me a wooden stick I can find every single detail about it (things like learning the history of wooden sticks, facts about wood, different uses of wooden sticks through time, etc) and probably think a way or two on how eventually make a business or money out of it (this does not mean I’m going to do it or that it is a viable idea, I just think this things naturally).</p>
<p>This natural enthusiasms towards everything life has to offer, was always considered by me as positive trait of my personality, but my thirst for knowledge on everything my hands touch is starting to become a burden. First of all because no matter how hard I try I cannot know everything (ego take note please) and second because I cannot really focus on anything. I just learn for the sake of learning on its own, which is great, but doesn’t get you anywhere, and this has been my struck-by-lighting moment of this Mexico journey. I keep moving from thing to thing without knowing where to land and right now I’m thriving to find something I can do anywhere in the world, managing my own time and growing on it (probably like everybody else), as this is the way I feel like living for the next couple of years.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago while talking about random stuff at dinnertime my roommate said that people that become the best on what they where doing (he sat as an example a famous chess player), breath, eat, sleep, journal, allocate their free time, move and walk doing what they want to become the best at. My boyfriend, a little less radical and quoting one of the hundred people he admires and reads their blog everyday, said you can only focus on 5 things and that all other things that might pop up are distractions. But my head has so many things going on that cannot really find a thing or even 5 things that are worth my time, as everything that is going on in my life deserves time.</p>
<p>After (finally) discovering this issue, I decided to do something. I considered therapy, but I know for a number of reasons this is not going to work: first because I’m an fervent activist against therapy (sorry) as I think all problems can be solved with an honest conversation with yourself, and secondly because is going to have me reading hours and hours of material on Freud, Young and every single other psychological current of the 20th century. But I do think I can apply the minimalist principle I’ve been applying to material things (clothes, kitchen stuff, etc) to this personal debate and this is how I’m going to do it:</p>
<p>Sit down and acknowledge the problem – always a great way to start
Start decluttering by making lists of everything that comes across my life and I feel the need to learn
Set priorities
Focus ONLY on these set priorities
Lower my own expectations and give my self time to explore each priority and see where they are getting me. With this comes the whole anxiety management too (hardest step ever)
Enjoying the journey and learn how to grow through baby steps
I’ll let you know how it went
Probably for many people this is a dah! kind of post, but for me this illuminating, and being able to express about it is mind-freeing too. So, 722 words later all I have to say to myself is ‘Let’s do it!’</p>
