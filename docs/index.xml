      <title>The Art of Discarding - Book</title>

      <description>Like everyone else, I heard about this book after reading Marie Kondo&amp;rsquo;s The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. We are about to move pretty soon and I need motivation and willingness to let things go. This book provided a lot of motivation for discarding, at times even a little bit too much.
Nagisa clearly states our underlying motivations for not getting rid of our possessions and how sooner or later stuff just ends up overflowing not only physical space but our mental space as well.</description>

      <description>I was planning on doing an entire month for my vitality category, but I changed my mind. These are the chief pillars for a healthy life and I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to implement them throughout the quarantine with varying degrees of success depending on the week.
In order not to get too overwhelmed I will add these important having in pairs every week. I have a small headstart, as my yoga practice is well established already (Ashtanga Primary Series 5 times a week) and, I&amp;rsquo;ve been meditating on and off.</description>

      <title>The Happiness Project - Book</title>

      <description>Often learn more from one person’s highly idiosyncratic experiences than I do from sources that detail universal principles or cite up-to-date studies. I find greater value in what specific individuals tell me worked for them than in any other kind of argument—and that’s true even when we seem to have nothing in common.
Gretchen Rubin&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Happiness Project&amp;rdquo; is exactly what the title anticipates: a recollection of her journey through finding a greater sense of joy and happiness through small habit changes.</description>

This is an orison to the HUGO-Gods. All this work is not to be in vain. A command shall appear before I and addhana will go live.
So please almighty-HUGO, listen to this prayer, and provide the solution to this predicament.</description>

      <description>Moving is an imminent fact, and therefore the &amp;ldquo;home &amp;amp; clutter&amp;rdquo; category seemed a great place to start my happiness project. Moving is not a minor activity, research cites it as the most stressful life event. Nonetheless, we run with an advantage. As we are moving to a completely different country, time zone, and hemisphere, we trully need to declutter and take only the essentials.
Apart from the physical objects, taking care of the emotional aspect is also tectonic because we won&amp;rsquo;t be living in Argentina for the next 4 years.</description>

      <description>You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.
  Habits compound, meaning what you do every day matters more than what you do once in a while.
  Never miss the same event/habit twice.
  Don’t judge easily, you never know what the other person is going through.
  Everything comes with time, so take the time and enjoy the journey.</description>

      <description>Quarantine has been a rediscovery of Dan Harris and his 10% happier project. I’ve attended all his live meditations (while they were running), enrolled in the TPH app, and I’ve been listening to his podcast almost daily. His book (10% happier) was the first audiobook I listened to in the theme of meditation and Buddhism. I was living in Mexico, just recently started dating Ted and I was open to trying new ways to improve my life.</description>

      <description>Like every Tuesday morning, yesterday I woke up early, kiss Frankie, and after an hour of journaling, I went grocery shopping.
But, unlike every other Tuesday, Blanca’s vegetable store was closed.
This minor setback disrupted my entire shopping experience. I was so upset. In my head, all there was were thoughts about how dare they close without letting me know and how I should probably start looking for a new vegetable place.</description>

      <description>Moving to the States is exciting for several reasons: Christmases are going to be snowy, and Thanksgiving dinners will have turkey again. But most importantly the amazing world of online shopping will be at our feet and God I’m looking forward to it.
With the COVID situation and the unsafeness associated with close contact activities, we decided the first purchase to be a peloton bike. But in order to make things a little bit more fun, we decided to add a small challenge.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I (finally) graduated from college. After years of hard work with countless hours with my butt in the chair and my nose between textbooks, I made it over 5 years of intense work, all summarized in a 40-minute presentation.
Many of my close friends gathered to see the whole thing unfold in youtube, and reading their comments and feeling their virtual presence had a nice comforting sensation in a time where the sense of isolation is the new norm.</description>

      <description>Today I’m feeling pretty much like Jack Konfield’s book tittle
After the ecstasy, the laundry Or like the fish in the final scene of Finding Nemo, looking around wondering
“now what?”
My undergraduate education concluded yesterday (I’m finally a licenciada), and today life’s goes on, with quarantine more strict than ever and lifting the garlands from the floor.
Nonetheless I’ve never felt luckier to be surrounded by so many amazing people.</description>

      <description>As part of my (many) quarantine challenges, I started playing Scrabble last week.
I’m not a natural. English is not my mother’s tongue and although I’ve always read a lot it was not until I had to sit for the GRE, and encountered the monstrous Verbal Section, that I made a conscious effort to expand my vocabulary.
The bright side of this whole endeavor is that there’s lots of room for improvement 🙂</description>

      <description>I recently finished the Success course offered by Wharton and all I can say are positive things about it. This course was great. The content in itself might not be mind-blowing (at the end of the day we all know that there’s an inner and outer sphere of success), but the exercises provided by Richard Shell, the instructor were poignant. They kept me thinking in these topics even after the lecture was done, and sparked pages of introspection in my morning journal.</description>

      <description>For someone whose first thought in the morning is setting the intention for a mindful day (however that wants to manifest itself that day) I found it fascinating how my mind has been residing in imagination this past couple of weeks. My last post is living proof of that. This quarantine, and the incapacity for action I feel due to the confinement has got me into self-centered loops of thoughts with a pretty obvious theme: wanting.</description>

      <description>We say that you cannot divert the river from the riverbed. We say that everything is moving, and we are part of this motion, that the soil is moving, that the water is moving. We say that the earth draws water to her from the clouds. We say the rainfall parts on each side of the mountain like the parting of our hair, and that the shape of the mountain tells where the water has passed.</description>

      <description>For my granddad. Happy 86th Birthday A couple of valuable lessons became evident after my grandma bashed to me over the phone the other day:
  #1. Her anger and mistreatment reflect nothing about me but everything about her. And more importantly, it is impersonal.
  #2. Non-engagement in violent speech is the best tool to dismembering the anger you are receiving from the other side. When two people are acting mean to each other it’s a fight but, when only one of the parties is involved it’s just a crazy person yelling over a phone.</description>

      <description>… and 5 thoughts on intermittent fasting (IF)  I.F. really help with my morning-crush. When I’m not fasting, after breakfast I experience low energy where I could think of is crawling back to bed. IF has really helped me with the morning crush, allowing me to be more productive and have a more energy-stable day Because I break my IF with a big healthy lunch, I’m less incline to take little snacks through out the day (although yesterday after a toxic conversation with my grandmother I ate half a carrot budín).</description>

      <description>1. When ordering ice cream it is important to only order fruit flavors or cream flavors. The mixture of the two is considered heresy. 2. Always read a book from cover to cover. You do not know what wisdom gems might be awaiting at the very end. 3. When your motives are unclear, is always better not to act. They might became apparent when emotions have settled. </description>

I’m using a great app, Zero, to track the 16:8 cycle.
Chores have been distributed the following way during the past couple of weeks of quarantine:
Mica – lunch Ted – dinner Since Monday Ted asks me (anxiously) around noon when I’m going to take care of lunch. Because of the 16 hour fast window, lately it has been around 2 o’clock, failing to realize this fundamental truth about our new lunch schedule:</description>

  Being in love is like that – silly, inexplicable
  It simply just happens
  Sometimes we do look for it a little bit under some random rocks we encounter in our journey.</description>

      <description>This quarantine was all about happiness, self- improvement, and habits. Yesterday I officially completed Yale’s most popular class ever and my 2nd (actually 3rd) Coursera course during the COVID19 lock-down, The Science of Well-Being.
I enjoyed the course so much, that I enrolled in the UPenn Foundations of Positive Psychology Specialization and already audited Part I. It is a long course lasting a total of 10 weeks, I manage to complete it in 5 weeks by bingeing the first week through all the lectures and leaving the last 4 weeks for the Final Reweirement Challenge.</description>

      <description>Papañca is the Pali term used to describe the tendency of the mind to spread out from and elaborate upon any sense object that arises in experience, smothering it with wave after wave of mental elaboration, most of which is illusory, repetitive, and even obsessive, which effectively blocks any sort of mental calm or clarity of mind.

      <description>I’m back! After a month almost of no updates, I decided (my followers, Ted, asked for it) to come back to blogging. Being in Argentina, these past weeks have been crazy with family meeting, friends to see, coffee shops to explore, studying to do, old photo albums to flip through, books to read, pinky foot toe to heal, habits to break. It also included my very first Thanksgiving celebration.
Holidays + Mexico Round 2 are coming soon and I could be more excited about what the future has to hold.</description>

Best fabrica de pasta – La Imperial. Glorious ravioli and fetuccini we (Ted) cooked to my family
Best medialunas – La de Vicente López. Service was okay, but oh my God those buttered medialunas are always the best</description>

      <description>The organization of my digital life just took a new level, I just started organizing my Google Photos website. I was always a little obsessed with photographs and not wanting to lose them so, it hurts to know all those pictures I lost from my teen years when cellphones and digital cameras just started, backups where a tedious thing and only god knows where those pictures are but I have a decent collection starting 2009 and from my early childhood (thanks mum).</description>

      <description>Time in Playa del Carmen is coming to an end. The next 10 days are fully occupied with traveling and DIY meditation retreats, so we decided take a day off and give one last visit technology-free visit of the year to our place in the world (La Zebra) .
My inner goal was to try to stay mindful all day (or at least most of it). So here are some mental highlights of the day:</description>

      <description>November 4th was my dad’s birthday so I called home to be present being far away. Truth is while I’m traveling I hardly ever call home, I don’t like it, too much me- focus, but I try to make exceptions during special occasion like this one. Half my family is at the country house, the other is getting there the next day for the big asado.
I haven’t even send him a text message as we were on our technology- free day off, out all day in Tulum; so I decided to do a ‘surprise’ WhatsApp video call.</description>

      <description>Philavery = an idiosyncratic collection of uncommon and pleasing words.
 I encountered Foyle’s Philavery, a little flowered covered book with red spines, while I was working at a bookshop a couple of years ago. The term stick with me so much that I used it as the tittle of my lists of new words in every journal since then. Here’s a small recollection of my last added words:</description>

      <description>page of ‘I Want my Hat back’ but Jon Klessen
After a week in which I experienced every flavor of thought available to mankind (anxiousness, sadness, hopelessness, happiness and anxiety again), I found the best way for coping with this fluctuating state of mind… simply re- read your favorite children’s book. The simplicity of it all gives you a great perspective of life.</description>

      <description>Holidays like Día de los muertos (Halloween) make me feel an outsider of my own species.
Is not that I don’t like going out, but I just don’t feel such a strong feeling to connect with the masses in these kind of commercial holidays, probably just using them as an excuse to either eat a bunch of sugar in the form of hard candy or get dressed in an unusual, weird ‘likely to be regretted a couple of years from now’ way, and get drunk.</description>

      <description>Life is a huge decision making process, everything revolving our lives was a decision taken at some point.
A big question is, what degree of freedom we have in our decisions? A few days ago this question was posted on our coffee break, and some people smarter than me stated there is no such thing as freewill, and that in this sense our brain does not really evaluate options, but the decision is already made.</description>

The memory of the first time I thought ‘There might be something here’ is still crystal clear in my mind. It was an afternoon, after our half- failed Appalachian hiking, we both were reading minding our own business but being there for each other. I was with my Kindle with ‘Eating animals‘, he was with his hardcover of ‘Why Buddhism is True‘. I was laying on the couch, he was sitting on the floor.</description>

Today’s morning was one of THOSE morning. You know, those type of mornings (sometimes it can last the whole day) where no matter what you are doing, you could always be doing something better.
When I was journaling, I wanted to study High Valyrian
When I was learning High Valyrian, I wanted to be at the 9am yoga class
When I decided I was not going to yoga in the morning but rather leave it for the afternoon, I wanted a coffee</description>

Today was a good days in many ways.

      <description>I’m a nerd.
There’s no news on the statement made above, I know it, you know it, we all know it, and fantasy books bring the most nerdy part of my personality. I read Harry Potter so many times in my life that I already lost count of them and the past couple of years my time has been divided between The Kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick Ruthfuss and, of course, the amazing A Song of Ice and Fire Series by GRR Martin (yes, I read the books before the series came out; no, I did not like the last season but every Sunday at 9pm I was religiously sat in front of the TV no matter what part of the world I was anyway).</description>

      <description>‘On Sundays the office is closed’ or so my boyfriend thought one of the first weekends we were at Playa del Carmen. I had woken up early to go to the market to buy groceries and such, when I saw a small stand were they were selling flowers; huge beautiful yellow, white, orange flowers. I thought flowers would make home a much cheerful place to work so I decided to buy flowers for my boyfriend.</description>

      <description>My first week of blogging is over and here are 7 highlights:
  According to people I write better than I talk (so imagine how I talk)
  It liberates your mind from random thoughts that keep appearing on a daily basis, it’s all about uncluttering
  Creating habits is easier when you are doing it with somebody else
  You can create a great unintended debate at dinnertime</description>

      <title>past</title>

      <description>It’s amazing how the past lingers with us, even when we try to push it away. How things that we worked so much on, in many cases convincing ourselves that we had made peace with them, can find us in the most unthought places triggered by the most unusual things, like a phrase on a blog post.
I think this is true because we cannot really escape from those deterrent moments that made us who we are, no matter how much emotional- baggage they still carry with them; and that is due to those moments, that we are where we are right now.</description>

      <description>I’m a natural enthusiast.
Wait! you never heard this before? Good, me neither and is because I just made this up. This is no psychological diagnose or anything of that sort is just the way I’ve always been and that I think, right now, is the main reason of a great distress in my head.
I think I’m going through a quarter-of-a-century kinda crisis. I wake up every morning not knowing what I am going to do or where I’m heading.</description>

      <title>Job Hunt</title>

      <description>After a couple months in low- season Playa del Carmen I came to the realization that life is harder than it seems. I never considered myself lucky with my past jobs (always grateful, never lucky) but after a month of trying to get a decent paycheck in Mexico I started believing I was. Being a full time student of an (yet) unfinished major for most of my adult life, working was never a top priority for me, so my past jobs were jobs that I performed to have some kind of personal income or to pay for that year’s vacation.</description>

      <description>Every night when I go to bed I kiss my boyfriend goodnight, look at him in the eyes and tell him ‘I love you, baby’, After what follows complete silence.
It’s been a little bit less than 2 months since I made that first statement driving through Virginia the day I decided I was going to loose my flight ticket to explore the perks of living in Mexico with someone I met on a plane.</description>

      <description>It was a beautiful late summer afternoon, we were sitting on the porch, drinking mate drinking in Harrisonburg, the day we decided to live with less stuff. “We should be able to name everything we own” and so we settle on the quest to own 123 things. And although we don’t really keep track of the amount of things do think we been living with less things we normally did and made smarter shopping decisions when we had to make a 2-month apartment into a home.</description>

      <title>Why am I doing this?</title>

      <description>Why am I writing a post a day? I think the best definition I could find was:
“I want to write down my thoughts somewhere where I won’t be able to loose them or throw them away”
ecause that’s our tendency as Homo sapiens, to project certain perfection or vision of ourselves and see if we can deceive ourselves along the way too.
In that way when a writing is not what we expect, we discard it; when a feeling that is not ‘positive’ or align with the ideal ‘me’ we tend to forget and pretend it was never there in the first place.</description>

      <description>“Writing a novel is like driving a car at night. You can only see as far as your headlights go, but you can make the whole trip that way”
E. L. Doctorow – Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott
And I kinda feel this is how my whole journey will go,
step by step, post by post
or as Anne’s father liked to say bird by bird
as I have never done anything like this before.</description>
