      <description>A list of side projects I started at some point and hope to continue in 2021  Personal Blog (addhana.com) or the website where you are reading this post: I won&amp;rsquo;t try to commit a blog a day because I don&amp;rsquo;t trust myself with that responsibility; I&amp;rsquo;ll simply try to keep it active and try to switch from guilt to fun. I&amp;rsquo;ve written quite a few posts in the last couple of weeks that I never pushed because I felt they were incomplete.</description>
