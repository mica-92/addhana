      <description>I’m a nerd.
There’s no news on the statement made above, I know it, you know it, we all know it, and fantasy books bring the most nerdy part of my personality. I read Harry Potter so many times in my life that I already lost count of them and the past couple of years my time has been divided between The Kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick Ruthfuss and, of course, the amazing A Song of Ice and Fire Series by GRR Martin (yes, I read the books before the series came out; no, I did not like the last season but every Sunday at 9pm I was religiously sat in front of the TV no matter what part of the world I was anyway).</description>
