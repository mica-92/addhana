      <description>Like everyone else, I heard about this book after reading Marie Kondo&amp;rsquo;s book. We are about to move pretty soon and I need motivation and willingness to let things go. This book provided a lot of motivation for discarding, at times even a little bit too much.
Nagisa clearly states our underlying motivations for not getting rid of our possessions and how sooner or later stuff just ends up overflowing not only physical space but our mental space as well.</description>

      <description>Moving is an imminent fact, and therefore the &amp;ldquo;home &amp;amp; clutter&amp;rdquo; category seemed a great place to start my happiness project. Moving is not a minor activity, research cited it as the most stressful life events. But we run with an advantage, we are moving to a completely different country, time zone, and hemisphere, so decluttering and picking up the essentials is a top priority. But apart from the physical objects, because we won&amp;rsquo;t be living in Argentina for the next 4 years taking care of the emotional aspect is also tectonic.</description>
