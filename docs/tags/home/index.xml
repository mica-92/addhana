      <description>For the last year or so I&amp;rsquo;ve been witnessing the unfolding of the United States&amp;rsquo; presidential election. NYT articles, debates, Friday&amp;rsquo;s Shields and Brooks analysis on PBS, Bill Maher, Sam Harris, you name it I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to it all. From the, at one point, 25 nominees of the Democratic Party only Biden is standing.
Ted is very happy about this fact. Although it would have never been his (or probably anybody&amp;rsquo;s) first choice, he seriously believes Biden is the one that will defeat Trump in November.</description>

      <title>The Art of Discarding - Book</title>

      <description>Like everyone else, I heard about this book after reading Marie Kondo&amp;rsquo;s The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. We are about to move pretty soon and I need motivation and willingness to let things go. This book provided a lot of motivation for discarding, at times even a little bit too much.
Nagisa clearly states our underlying motivations for not getting rid of our possessions and how sooner or later stuff just ends up overflowing not only physical space but our mental space as well.</description>

      <description>Moving is an imminent fact, and therefore the &amp;ldquo;home &amp;amp; clutter&amp;rdquo; category seemed a great place to start my happiness project. Moving is not a minor activity, research cites it as the most stressful life event. Nonetheless, we run with an advantage. As we are moving to a completely different country, time zone, and hemisphere, we trully need to declutter and take only the essentials.
Apart from the physical objects, taking care of the emotional aspect is also tectonic because we won&amp;rsquo;t be living in Argentina for the next 4 years.</description>
