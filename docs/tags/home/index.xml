      <title>KonMari - A Reread</title>

      <description>Growing up, the way my parent&amp;rsquo;s house looked was always a source of stress for me. I was never comfortable. Bringing friends was an avoid-at-all-cost-task. Nothing ever seemed to have a place and stuff just pilled everywhere. Although I won&amp;rsquo;t get into too much detail, I now can understand how that happened (but I do struggle to see how it can still be going on).
So, as soon as I moved with Ted I wanted to avoid all the mistakes I felt my parent&amp;rsquo;s made in their own space.</description>

      <title>The Art of Discarding - Book</title>

      <description>Like everyone else, I heard about this book after reading Marie Kondo&amp;rsquo;s The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. We are about to move pretty soon and I need motivation and willingness to let things go. This book provided a lot of motivation for discarding, at times even a little bit too much.
Nagisa clearly states our underlying motivations for not getting rid of our possessions and how sooner or later stuff just ends up overflowing not only physical space but our mental space as well.</description>

      <title>#1 Home &amp; clutter</title>

      <description>Moving is an imminent fact, and therefore the &amp;ldquo;home &amp;amp; clutter&amp;rdquo; category seemed a great place to start my happiness project. Moving is not a minor activity, research cites it as the most stressful life event. Nonetheless, we run with an advantage. As we are moving to a completely different country, time zone, and hemisphere, we trully need to declutter and take only the essentials.
Apart from the physical objects, taking care of the emotional aspect is also tectonic because we won&amp;rsquo;t be living in Argentina for the next 4 years.</description>
