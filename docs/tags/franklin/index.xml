      <description>In another chapter of Mica-Designs, a fellow graduate student ask me to help her design a logo for raising funds for a Hurricane Relief Fund for Central America.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on and off with these ones for the past couple of weeks, not really knowing what Nati wanted or finding sources of inspiration on Google. These are the ones I ended up picking for her :)

      <description>As I observe Franklin every day, I wonder how something with such a strong character -with defined tastes and ways of communicating what he wants- not to be conscious?
For me, Frankie presents all the attributes by which I believe there&amp;rsquo;s a Mica. I have a distinct personality, erratic and highly emotional, and ways of expressing to the world who and how I am. And Franklin does too. His toolbox is different than mine.</description>
