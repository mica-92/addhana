      <description>My typing skills are horrible, and for quite a few months Ted has been emphasizing the importance of developing this skill.
A healthy bet has emerged between Ted and I. I need to get to an average of 50 wpm faster than him to 100 wpm typing.
My initial average 26.2 wpm (07/28). Current average 34.3 wpm (08/06)
The loser has to prepare a fancy dinner.

      <description>Moving to the States is exciting for several reasons: Christmases are going to be snowy, and Thanksgiving dinners will have turkey again. But most importantly the amazing world of online shopping will be at our feet and God Iâ€™m looking forward to it.
