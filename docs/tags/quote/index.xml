      <description>&amp;ldquo;I had learned early on to pay close attention whenever an idea is dismissed as ‚Äúimpossible.‚Äù Most of the time, scientists are referring to something that is truly out of the question, like violating the conservation of energy or creating a perpetual motion machine. It never makes sense to pursue those kinds of ideas. But sometimes, an idea is judged to be ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù based on assumptions that could be violated under certain circumstances that have never been considered before.</description>

      <description>We say that you cannot divert the river from the riverbed. We say that everything is moving, and we are part of this motion, that the soil is moving, that the water is moving. We say that the earth draws water to her from the clouds. We say the rainfall parts on each side of the mountain like the parting of our hair, and that the shape of the mountain tells where the water has passed.</description>

      <description> The meaning of life is just to be alive. It is so plain and so obvious and so simple. And yet, everybody rushes around in a great panic as if it were necessary to achieve something beyond themselves

      <description>La ventura va guiando nuestras cosas mejor de lo que acert√°ramos a desear; porque ves all√≠, amigo Sancho Panza, donde se descubren treinta o pocos m√°s desaforados gigantes, con quien pienso hacer batalla y quitarles a todos las vidas, con cuyos despojos comenzaremos a enriquecer, que esta es buena guerra, y es gran servicio de Dios quitar tan mala simiente de sobre la faz de la tierra
