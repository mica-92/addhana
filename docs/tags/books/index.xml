      <description>Growing up, the way my parent&amp;rsquo;s house looked was always a source of stress for me. I was never comfortable. Bringing friends was an avoid-at-all-cost-task. Nothing ever seemed to have a place and stuff just pilled everywhere. Although I won&amp;rsquo;t get into too much detail, I now can understand how that happened (but I do struggle to see how it can still be going on).
So, as soon as I moved with Ted I wanted to avoid all the mistakes I felt my parent&amp;rsquo;s made in their own space.</description>

      <description>Like everyone else, I heard about this book after reading Marie Kondo&amp;rsquo;s The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. We are about to move pretty soon and I need motivation and willingness to let things go. This book provided a lot of motivation for discarding, at times even a little bit too much.
Nagisa clearly states our underlying motivations for not getting rid of our possessions and how sooner or later stuff just ends up overflowing not only physical space but our mental space as well.</description>

      <title>The Happiness Project - Book</title>

      <description>Often learn more from one person‚Äôs highly idiosyncratic experiences than I do from sources that detail universal principles or cite up-to-date studies. I find greater value in what specific individuals tell me worked for them than in any other kind of argument‚Äîand that‚Äôs true even when we seem to have nothing in common.
Gretchen Rubin&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Happiness Project&amp;rdquo; is exactly what the title anticipates: a recollection of her journey through finding a greater sense of joy and happiness through small habit changes.</description>

      <description>page of ‚ÄòI Want my Hat back‚Äô but Jon Klessen
After a week in which I experienced every flavor of thought available to mankind (anxiousness, sadness, hopelessness, happiness and anxiety again), I found the best way for coping with this fluctuating state of mind‚Ä¶ simply re- read your favorite children‚Äôs book. The simplicity of it all gives you a great perspective of life.</description>
