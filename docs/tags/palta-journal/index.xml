      <description>I‚Äôm back! After a month almost of no updates, I decided (my followers, Ted, asked for it) to come back to blogging. Being in Argentina, these past weeks have been crazy with family meeting, friends to see, coffee shops to explore, studying to do, old photo albums to flip through, books to read, pinky foot toe to heal, habits to break. It also included my very first Thanksgiving celebration.
Holidays + Mexico Round 2 are coming soon and I could be more excited about what the future has to hold.</description>

      <description>Since Ted told me he was coming to Buenos Aires I made a list of my favorite spots in my neighborhood, La Lucila. Almost a week into our Buenos Aires adventure (or how we call it, Chapter 6) this is how out list is going
Best fabrica de pasta ‚Äì La Imperial. Glorious ravioli and fetuccini we (Ted) cooked to my family
Best medialunas ‚Äì La de Vicente L√≥pez. Service was okay, but oh my God those buttered medialunas are always the best</description>

      <description>The organization of my digital life just took a new level, I just started organizing my Google Photos website. I was always a little obsessed with photographs and not wanting to lose them so, it hurts to know all those pictures I lost from my teen years when cellphones and digital cameras just started, backups where a tedious thing and only god knows where those pictures are but I have a decent collection starting 2009 and from my early childhood (thanks mum).</description>

      <description>Time in Playa del Carmen is coming to an end. The next 10 days are fully occupied with traveling and DIY meditation retreats, so we decided take a day off and give one last visit technology-free visit of the year to our place in the world (La Zebra) .
My inner goal was to try to stay mindful all day (or at least most of it). So here are some mental highlights of the day:</description>

      <description>November 4th was my dad‚Äôs birthday so I called home to be present being far away. Truth is while I‚Äôm traveling I hardly ever call home, I don‚Äôt like it, too much me- focus, but I try to make exceptions during special occasion like this one. Half my family is at the country house, the other is getting there the next day for the big asado.
I haven‚Äôt even send him a text message as we were on our technology- free day off, out all day in Tulum; so I decided to do a ‚Äòsurprise‚Äô WhatsApp video call.</description>

      <description>Philavery = an idiosyncratic collection of uncommon and pleasing words.
 I encountered Foyle‚Äôs Philavery, a little flowered covered book with red spines, while I was working at a bookshop a couple of years ago. The term stick with me so much that I used it as the tittle of my lists of new words in every journal since then. Here‚Äôs a small recollection of my last added words:</description>

      <description>page of ‚ÄòI Want my Hat back‚Äô but Jon Klessen
After a week in which I experienced every flavor of thought available to mankind (anxiousness, sadness, hopelessness, happiness and anxiety again), I found the best way for coping with this fluctuating state of mind‚Ä¶ simply re- read your favorite children‚Äôs book. The simplicity of it all gives you a great perspective of life.</description>

      <description>Holidays like D√≠a de los muertos (Halloween) make me feel an outsider of my own species.
Is not that I don‚Äôt like going out, but I just don‚Äôt feel such a strong feeling to connect with the masses in these kind of commercial holidays, probably just using them as an excuse to either eat a bunch of sugar in the form of hard candy or get dressed in an unusual, weird ‚Äòlikely to be regretted a couple of years from now‚Äô way, and get drunk.</description>

      <description>Life is a huge decision making process, everything revolving our lives was a decision taken at some point.
A big question is, what degree of freedom we have in our decisions? A few days ago this question was posted on our coffee break, and some people smarter than me stated there is no such thing as freewill, and that in this sense our brain does not really evaluate options, but the decision is already made.</description>

      <description>The Moment
The memory of the first time I thought ‚ÄòThere might be something here‚Äô is still crystal clear in my mind. It was an afternoon, after our half- failed Appalachian hiking, we both were reading minding our own business but being there for each other. I was with my Kindle with ‚ÄòEating animals‚Äò, he was with his hardcover of ‚ÄòWhy Buddhism is True‚Äò. I was laying on the couch, he was sitting on the floor.</description>

Today‚Äôs morning was one of THOSE morning. You know, those type of mornings (sometimes it can last the whole day) where no matter what you are doing, you could always be doing something better.
When I was journaling, I wanted to study High Valyrian
When I was learning High Valyrian, I wanted to be at the 9am yoga class
When I decided I was not going to yoga in the morning but rather leave it for the afternoon, I wanted a coffee</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm a nerd.
There‚Äôs no news on the statement made above, I know it, you know it, we all know it, and fantasy books bring the most nerdy part of my personality. I read Harry Potter so many times in my life that I already lost count of them and the past couple of years my time has been divided between The Kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick Ruthfuss and, of course, the amazing A Song of Ice and Fire Series by GRR Martin (yes, I read the books before the series came out; no, I did not like the last season but every Sunday at 9pm I was religiously sat in front of the TV no matter what part of the world I was anyway).</description>

      <description>‚ÄòOn Sundays the office is closed‚Äô or so my boyfriend thought one of the first weekends we were at Playa del Carmen. I had woken up early to go to the market to buy groceries and such, when I saw a small stand were they were selling flowers; huge beautiful yellow, white, orange flowers. I thought flowers would make home a much cheerful place to work so I decided to buy flowers for my boyfriend.</description>

      <description>My first week of blogging is over and here are 7 highlights:
  According to people I write better than I talk (so imagine how I talk)
  It liberates your mind from random thoughts that keep appearing on a daily basis, it‚Äôs all about uncluttering
  Creating habits is easier when you are doing it with somebody else
  You can create a great unintended debate at dinnertime</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs amazing how the past lingers with us, even when we try to push it away. How things that we worked so much on, in many cases convincing ourselves that we had made peace with them, can find us in the most unthought places triggered by the most unusual things, like a phrase on a blog post.
I think this is true because we cannot really escape from those deterrent moments that made us who we are, no matter how much emotional- baggage they still carry with them; and that is due to those moments, that we are where we are right now.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm a natural enthusiast.
Wait! you never heard this before? Good, me neither and is because I just made this up. This is no psychological diagnose or anything of that sort is just the way I‚Äôve always been and that I think, right now, is the main reason of a great distress in my head.
I think I‚Äôm going through a quarter-of-a-century kinda crisis. I wake up every morning not knowing what I am going to do or where I‚Äôm heading.</description>

      <title>Job Hunt</title>

      <description>After a couple months in low- season Playa del Carmen I came to the realization that life is harder than it seems. I never considered myself lucky with my past jobs (always grateful, never lucky) but after a month of trying to get a decent paycheck in Mexico I started believing I was. Being a full time student of an (yet) unfinished major for most of my adult life, working was never a top priority for me, so my past jobs were jobs that I performed to have some kind of personal income or to pay for that year‚Äôs vacation.</description>

      <description>Every night when I go to bed I kiss my boyfriend goodnight, look at him in the eyes and tell him ‚ÄòI love you, baby‚Äô, After what follows complete silence.
It‚Äôs been a little bit less than 2 months since I made that first statement driving through Virginia the day I decided I was going to loose my flight ticket to explore the perks of living in Mexico with someone I met on a plane.</description>

      <description>It was a beautiful late summer afternoon, we were sitting on the porch, drinking mate drinking in Harrisonburg, the day we decided to live with less stuff. ‚ÄúWe should be able to name everything we own‚Äù and so we settle on the quest to own 123 things. And although we don‚Äôt really keep track of the amount of things do think we been living with less things we normally did and made smarter shopping decisions when we had to make a 2-month apartment into a home.</description>

      <title>Why am I doing this?</title>

      <description>Why am I writing a post a day? I think the best definition I could find was:
‚ÄúI want to write down my thoughts somewhere where I won‚Äôt be able to loose them or throw them away‚Äù
ecause that‚Äôs our tendency as Homo sapiens, to project certain perfection or vision of ourselves and see if we can deceive ourselves along the way too.
In that way when a writing is not what we expect, we discard it; when a feeling that is not ‚Äòpositive‚Äô or align with the ideal ‚Äòme‚Äô we tend to forget and pretend it was never there in the first place.</description>

      <description>‚ÄúWriting a novel is like driving a car at night. You can only see as far as your headlights go, but you can make the whole trip that way‚Äù
E. L. Doctorow ‚Äì Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott
And I kinda feel this is how my whole journey will go,
step by step, post by post
or as Anne‚Äôs father liked to say bird by bird
as I have never done anything like this before.</description>
