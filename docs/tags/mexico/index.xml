      <description> The meaning of life is just to be alive. It is so plain and so obvious and so simple. And yet, everybody rushes around in a great panic as if it were necessary to achieve something beyond themselves

      <description>Time in Playa del Carmen is coming to an end. The next 10 days are fully occupied with traveling and DIY meditation retreats, so we decided take a day off and give one last visit technology-free visit of the year to our place in the world (La Zebra) .
My inner goal was to try to stay mindful all day (or at least most of it). So here are some mental highlights of the day:</description>

      <description>Holidays like DÃ­a de los muertos (Halloween) make me feel an outsider of my own species.
Is not that I donâ€™t like going out, but I just donâ€™t feel such a strong feeling to connect with the masses in these kind of commercial holidays, probably just using them as an excuse to either eat a bunch of sugar in the form of hard candy or get dressed in an unusual, weird â€˜likely to be regretted a couple of years from nowâ€™ way, and get drunk.</description>

      <description>Iâ€™m a natural enthusiast.
Wait! you never heard this before? Good, me neither and is because I just made this up. This is no psychological diagnose or anything of that sort is just the way Iâ€™ve always been and that I think, right now, is the main reason of a great distress in my head.
I think Iâ€™m going through a quarter-of-a-century kinda crisis. I wake up every morning not knowing what I am going to do or where Iâ€™m heading.</description>

      <title>Job Hunt</title>

      <description>After a couple months in low- season Playa del Carmen I came to the realization that life is harder than it seems. I never considered myself lucky with my past jobs (always grateful, never lucky) but after a month of trying to get a decent paycheck in Mexico I started believing I was. Being a full time student of an (yet) unfinished major for most of my adult life, working was never a top priority for me, so my past jobs were jobs that I performed to have some kind of personal income or to pay for that yearâ€™s vacation.</description>
