      <description>Sometimes in the midst of our daily routine, we simply forget to breathe.
To breathe and look around us. To realize that we are exactly where we want to be. That all the work we are putting in will eventually pay off, the same way it paid off in the past, which got us to the place we are right now - drinking mate, thousand miles away from home, and going through my favorite season for the second time this year.</description>

      <description>This week has all been about moving to Philly and getting ready for the fall semester. As part of my graduate education, I have to TA for at least two semesters. I am thrilled about this new role. Teaching has always been something I wanted to give it a try, something that I could see my self doing as a career path along with being part of a research team. Before throwing us to the wolves, the school offered a two week TA training, and opposite to my expectations, I found the seminars very insightful.</description>

      <description>And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
I&amp;rsquo;m still on that tightrope
I&amp;rsquo;m still trying everything to get you laughing at me
And I&amp;rsquo;m still a believer, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know why
I&amp;rsquo;ve never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
I&amp;rsquo;m still on that trapeze
I&amp;rsquo;m still trying everything to keep you looking at me</description>
