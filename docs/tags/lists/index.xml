      <description>#1 7 days.#2 Tomorrow: 28.
#3 Folklore is better with every listen.
&#39;Cause I knew you
Steppin&#39; on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin&#39; like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing‚Äî Cardigan, Taylor Swift</description>

      <description>You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.
  Habits compound, meaning what you do every day matters more than what you do once in a while.
  Never miss the same event/habit twice.
  Don‚Äôt judge easily, you never know what the other person is going through.
  Everything comes with time, so take the time and enjoy the journey.</description>

      <description>Since Ted told me he was coming to Buenos Aires I made a list of my favorite spots in my neighborhood, La Lucila. Almost a week into our Buenos Aires adventure (or how we call it, Chapter 6) this is how out list is going
Best fabrica de pasta ‚Äì La Imperial. Glorious ravioli and fetuccini we (Ted) cooked to my family
Best medialunas ‚Äì La de Vicente L√≥pez. Service was okay, but oh my God those buttered medialunas are always the best</description>
