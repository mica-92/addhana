      <description>In the past months I went from being the happy state of singletown to the happy silly state of â€˜Hey! This is my boyfriend. Have I told you he is the most amazing person in the world (yes, probably like a thousand times)
  Being in love is like that â€“ silly, inexplicable
  It simply just happens
  Sometimes we do look for it a little bit under some random rocks we encounter in our journey.</description>

      <description>This quarantine was all about happiness, self- improvement, and habits. Yesterday I officially completed Yaleâ€™s most popular class ever and my 2nd (actually 3rd) Coursera course during the COVID19 lock-down, The Science of Well-Being.
I enjoyed the course so much, that I enrolled in the UPenn Foundations of Positive Psychology Specialization and already audited Part I. It is a long course lasting a total of 10 weeks, I manage to complete it in 5 weeks by bingeing the first week through all the lectures and leaving the last 4 weeks for the Final Reweirement Challenge.</description>
