      <description>This week has all been about moving to Philly and getting ready for the fall semester. As part of my graduate education, I have to TA for at least two semesters.

Before throwing us to the wolves, the school offered a two week TA training, and opposite to my expectations, I found the seminars very insightful.</description>
