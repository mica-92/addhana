      <title>Being on the good side of statistics</title>

      <description>Despite all the uncertainty surrounding COVID, we have sufficient evidence to show that death rates among young adults are pretty low. It is possibly even lower if the individual has no pre-existing conditions (like asthma or some auto-immune disease). But even with a death-rate of 0.1% is 500% more than the one we observe in the regular flu-season (0.02%).
I know I am on the good side of statistics. If, by any chance, I get COVID, there&amp;rsquo;s a big chance I end up having only mild symptoms and no severe, long-lasting effects.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the best description I found on how to write an email to a prospect member of your graduate committee in the middle of a global pandemic:
&#34;Hey I just met you.And this is crazy.
But here&#39;s my number
Committee, maybe?&#34;
But the good news even with all that ackwardness 3 out of 5 have already accepted. One if from New Zealand :)
I&amp;rsquo;m counting on you Doug and Ileana!</description>

Introduction to QM  Class: MSE 570 Reviewed: No Type: Study Notes Week: 37- 2020  A little bit of history  The main inconvenience with the classical view of the atom, the Rutherford model, was that it was known already that a particle accelerating in an EM field would eradiate its energy.</description>

      <description>This week has all been about moving to Philly and getting ready for the fall semester. As part of my graduate education, I have to TA for at least two semesters. I am thrilled about this new role. Teaching has always been something I wanted to give it a try, something that I could see my self doing as a career path along with being part of a research team. Before throwing us to the wolves, the school offered a two week TA training, and opposite to my expectations, I found the seminars very insightful.</description>
