      <description>My typing skills are horrible, and for quite a few months Ted has been emphasizing the importance of developing this skill.
A healthy bet has emerged between Ted and I. I need to get to an average of 50 wpm faster than him to 100 wpm typing.
My initial average 26.2 wpm (07/28). Current average 34.3 wpm (08/06)
The loser has to prepare a fancy dinner.

      <description>For the last year or so I&amp;rsquo;ve been witnessing the unfolding of the United States&amp;rsquo; presidential election. NYT articles, debates, Friday&amp;rsquo;s Shields and Brooks analysis on PBS, Bill Maher, Sam Harris, you name it I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to it all. From the, at one point, 25 nominees of the Democratic Party only Biden is standing.
Ted is very happy about this fact. Although it would have never been his (or probably anybody&amp;rsquo;s) first choice, he seriously believes Biden is the one that will defeat Trump in November.</description>
