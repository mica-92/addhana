      <description>One final resolution I sat for 2020 was to upgrade my professional information. For this, I create a Research Gate and LinkedIn account, make available to the world my undergrad-senior thesis, and update my CV with a profile section (+ try to make it bulkier with some minor recent accomplishments).
Little would I&amp;rsquo;ve known that my rÃ©sumÃ©&amp;rsquo;s final version will evolve to be a personal website. The thoughts behind this crazy endeavor lay in the fact that developing my professional website will give lots of room to explore and share my research and other professional interest with everyone while being detached from the social media standards and recipes.</description>

      <description>A list of side projects I started at some point and hope to continue in 2021  Personal Blog (addhana.com) or the website where you are reading this post: I won&amp;rsquo;t try to commit a blog a day because I don&amp;rsquo;t trust myself with that responsibility; I&amp;rsquo;ll simply try to keep it active and try to switch from guilt to fun. I&amp;rsquo;ve written quite a few posts in the last couple of weeks that I never pushed because I felt they were incomplete.</description>
