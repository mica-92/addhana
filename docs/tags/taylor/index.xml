      <description>After writing my senior thesis under the influence of Lover
Living my first Penn semester with folklore on repeat.
Crying with the long pond sessions
evermore is the best way to share my return home. </description>

      <description>And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
I&amp;rsquo;m still on that tightrope
I&amp;rsquo;m still trying everything to get you laughing at me
And I&amp;rsquo;m still a believer, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know why
I&amp;rsquo;ve never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
I&amp;rsquo;m still on that trapeze
I&amp;rsquo;m still trying everything to keep you looking at me</description>

      <description>#1 7 days.#2 Tomorrow: 28.
#3 Folklore is better with every listen.
&#39;Cause I knew you
Steppin&#39; on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin&#39; like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothingâ€” Cardigan, Taylor Swift</description>
