      <description>Yesterday I (finally) graduated from college. After years of hard work with countless hours with my but in the chairs and my nose between textbooks I made it over 5 years of intense work where summarized in a 40-minute presentation.
Many of my close friends gathered to see the whole thing unfold in youtube, and reading their comments and feeling their virtual presence had a nice comforting sensation in a time where the sense of isolation is the new norm.</description>

      <description>Today I’m feeling pretty much like Jack Konfield’s book tittle
After the ecstasy, the laundry Or like the fish in the final scene of Finding Nemo, looking around wondering
“now what?”
My undergraduate education concluded yesterday (I’m finally a licenciada), and today life’s goes on, with quarantine more strict than ever and lifting the garlands from the floor.
Nonetheless I’ve never felt luckier to be surrounded by so many amazing people.</description>

It is hard finding someone that does not recommend ‘A Gentleman in Moscow‘, from my mother-in-law to my boyfriend and Bill Gates, Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov seems to have earned a place in everyone’s heart.</description>

      <description>As part of my (many) quarantine challenges, I started playing Scrabble last week.
I’m not a natural. English is not my mother’s tongue and although I’ve always read a lot it was not until I had to sit for the GRE, and encountered the monstrous Verbal Section, that I made a conscious effort to expand my vocabulary.
The bright side of this whole endeavor is that there’s lots of room for improvement 🙂</description>

      <description>I recently finished the Success course offered by Wharton and all I can say are positive things about it. This course was great. The content in itself might not be mind-blowing (at the end of the day we all know that there’s an inner and outer sphere of success), but the exercises provided by Richard Shell, the instructor were poignant. They kept me thinking in these topics even after the lecture was done, and sparked pages of introspection in my morning journal.</description>

      <description>For someone whose first thought in the morning is setting the intention for a mindful day (however that wants to manifest itself that day) I found it fascinating how my mind has been residing in imagination this past couple of weeks. My last post is living proof of that. This quarantine, and the incapacity for action I feel due to the confinement has got me into self-centered loops of thoughts with a pretty obvious theme: wanting.</description>

      <description>I wish I there was no COVID; I wish there was no quarantine; I wish it hasn’t been extended two more weeks; I wish I had bought a sewing machine a couple of months ago; I wish I could have all the right colors of yarn to crochet all the amigurumi in Pica Pau’s latest book; I wish I would have started learning to weave, now I do not have a loom; I wish I was in Mexico; I wish I was in Malta; I wish I was in the Philippines or maybe Bali; I wish we were already in Philly; I wish I could have been with my grandad in his birthday (May 16th); I wish I can be with my brother in his birthday (June 19th), at least I was able to be with Ted in his birthday (April 29th); I’ll probably be able to be with my mum in her 50th birthday, right?</description>

      <description>We say that you cannot divert the river from the riverbed. We say that everything is moving, and we are part of this motion, that the soil is moving, that the water is moving. We say that the earth draws water to her from the clouds. We say the rainfall parts on each side of the mountain like the parting of our hair, and that the shape of the mountain tells where the water has passed.</description>

      <description>For my granddad. Happy 86th Birthday A couple of valuable lessons became evident after my grandma bashed to me over the phone the other day:
  #1. Her anger and mistreatment reflect nothing about me but everything about her. And more importantly, it is impersonal.
  #2. Non-engagement in violent speech is the best tool to dismembering the anger you are receiving from the other side. When two people are acting mean to each other it’s a fight but, when only one of the parties is involved it’s just a crazy person yelling over a phone.</description>

      <description>… and 5 thoughts on intermittent fasting (IF)  I.F. really help with my morning-crush. When I’m not fasting, after breakfast I experience low energy where I could think of is crawling back to bed. IF has really helped me with the morning crush, allowing me to be more productive and have a more energy-stable day Because I break my IF with a big healthy lunch, I’m less incline to take little snacks through out the day (although yesterday after a toxic conversation with my grandmother I ate half a carrot budín).</description>

      <description>1. When ordering ice cream it is important to only order fruit flavors or cream flavors. The mixture of the two is considered heresy. 2. Always read a book from cover to cover. You do not know what wisdom gems might be awaiting at the very end 3. When your motives are unclear, is always better not to act. They might became apparent when emotions have settled. </description>

      <description>Since Sunday I’ve began intermittent fasting.
I’m using a great app, Zero, to track the 16:8 cycle.
Chores have been distributed the following way during the past couple of weeks of quarantine:
Mica – lunch Ted – dinner Since Monday Ted asks me (anxiously) around noon when I’m going to take care of lunch. Because of the 16 hour fast window, lately it has been around 2 o’clock, failing to realize this fundamental truth about our new lunch schedule:</description>

      <description>In the past months I went from being the happy state of singletown to the happy silly state of ‘Hey! This is my boyfriend. Have I told you he is the most amazing person in the world (yes, probably like a thousand times)
  Being in love is like that – silly, inexplicable
  It simply just happens
  Sometimes we do look for it a little bit under some random rocks we encounter in our journey</description>

      <description>This quarantine was all about happiness, self- improvement, and habits. Yesterday I officially completed Yale’s most popular class ever and my 2nd (actually 3rd) Coursera course during the COVID19 lock-down, The Science of Well-Being.
I enjoyed the course so much, that I enrolled in the UPenn Foundations of Positive Psychology Specialization and already audited Part I. It is a long course lasting a total of 10 weeks, I manage to complete it in 5 weeks by bingeing the first week through all the lectures and leaving the last 4 weeks for the Final Reweirement Challenge.</description>

      <description>I absolutely loved this course. Robert Wright is a funny guy and his way of delivering hard concepts is pretty good. The course tries to bring together the Naturalistic (sometimes called Secular) notions of Buddhism under the scientific framework of Modern Evolutionary Psychology.

Every morning after watching my little Buddha contemplate the Truth of impermanence from his favorite spot in the balcony, I wonder if the opposite can be true.

      <description>Papañca is the Pali term used to describe the tendency of the mind to spread out from and elaborate upon any sense object that arises in experience, smothering it with wave after wave of mental elaboration, most of which is illusory, repetitive, and even obsessive, which effectively blocks any sort of mental calm or clarity of mind.
